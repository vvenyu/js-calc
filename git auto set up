[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       You can query/set/replace/unset options with this command. The name is
       actually the section and the key separated by a dot, and the value will
       be escaped.

       Multiple lines can be added to an option by using the [1m--append [22moption.
       If you want to update or unset an option which can occur on multiple
       lines, [1m--value=[4m[22m<pattern>[24m (which is an extended regular expression,
       unless the [1m--fixed-value [22moption is given) needs to be given. Only the
       existing values that match the pattern are updated or unset. If you want
       to handle the lines that do [1mnot [22mmatch the pattern, just prepend a single
       exclamation mark in front (see also the section called “EXAMPLES”), but
       note that this only works when the [1m--fixed-value [22moption is not in use.

       The [1m--type=[4m[22m<type>[24m option instructs [4mgit[24m [4mconfig[24m to ensure that incoming
       and outgoing values are canonicalize-able under the given <type>. If no
       [1m--type=[4m[22m<type>[24m is given, no canonicalization will be performed. Callers
       may unset an existing [1m--type [22mspecifier with [1m--no-type[22m.

       When reading, the values are read from the system, global and repository
       local configuration files by default, and options [1m--system[22m, [1m--global[22m,
       [1m--local[22m, [1m--worktree [22mand [1m--file [4m[22m<filename>[24m can be used to tell the
       command to read from only that location (see the section called
       “FILES”).

       When writing, the new value is written to the repository local
       configuration file by default, and options [1m--system[22m, [1m--global[22m,
       [1m--worktree[22m, [1m--file [4m[22m<filename>[24m can be used to tell the command to write
       to that location (you can say [1m--local [22mbut that is the default).

       This command will fail with non-zero status upon error. Some exit codes
       are:

       •   The section or key is invalid (ret=1),

       •   no section or name was provided (ret=2),

       •   the config file is invalid (ret=3),

       •   the config file cannot be written (ret=4),

       •   you try to unset an option which does not exist (ret=5),

       •   you try to unset/set an option for which multiple lines match
           (ret=5), or

       •   you try to use an invalid regexp (ret=6).

       On success, the command returns the exit code 0.

       A list of all available configuration variables can be obtained using
       the [1mgit help --config [22mcommand.

[1mCOMMANDS[0m
       list
           List all variables set in config file, along with their values.

       get
           Emits the value of the specified key. If key is present multiple
           times in the configuration, emits the last value. If [1m--all [22mis
           specified, emits all values associated with key. Returns error code
           1 if key is not present.

       set
           Set value for one or more config options. By default, this command
           refuses to write multi-valued config options. Passing [1m--all [22mwill
           replace all multi-valued config options with the new value, whereas
           [1m--value= [22mwill replace all config options whose values match the
           given pattern.

       unset
           Unset value for one or more config options. By default, this command
           refuses to unset multi-valued keys. Passing [1m--all [22mwill unset all
           multi-valued config options, whereas [1m--value [22mwill unset all config
           options whose values match the given pattern.

       rename-section
           Rename the given section to a new name.

       remove-section
           Remove the given section from the configuration file.

       edit
           Opens an editor to modify the specified config file; either
           [1m--system[22m, [1m--global[22m, [1m--local [22m(default), [1m--worktree[22m, or [1m--file[0m
           [4m<config-file>[24m.

[1mOPTIONS[0m
       --replace-all
           Default behavior is to replace at most one line. This replaces all
           lines matching the key (and optionally [1m--value=[4m[22m<pattern>[24m).

       --append
           Adds a new line to the option without altering any existing values.
           This is the same as providing [4m--value=^$[24m in [1mset[22m.

       --comment <message>
           Append a comment at the end of new or modified lines.

               If _<message>_ begins with one or more whitespaces followed
               by "#", it is used as-is.  If it begins with "#", a space is
               prepended before it is used.  Otherwise, a string " # " (a
               space followed by a hash followed by a space) is prepended
               to it.  And the resulting string is placed immediately after
               the value defined for the variable.  The _<message>_ must
               not contain linefeed characters (no multi-line comments are
               permitted).

       --all
           With [1mget[22m, return all values for a multi-valued key.

       --regexp
           With [1mget[22m, interpret the name as a regular expression. Regular
           expression matching is currently case-sensitive and done against a
           canonicalized version of the key in which section and variable names
           are lowercased, but subsection names are not.

       --url=<URL>
           When given a two-part <name> as <section>.<key>, the value for
           <section>.<URL>.<key> whose <URL> part matches the best to the given
           URL is returned (if no such key exists, the value for
           <section>.<key> is used as a fallback). When given just the
           <section> as name, do so for all the keys in the section and list
           them. Returns error code 1 if no value is found.

       --global
           For writing options: write to global [1m~/.gitconfig [22mfile rather than
           the repository [1m.git/config[22m, write to [1m$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/config[0m
           file if this file exists and the [1m~/.gitconfig [22mfile doesn’t.

           For reading options: read only from global [1m~/.gitconfig [22mand from
           [1m$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/config [22mrather than from all available files.

           See also the section called “FILES”.

       --system
           For writing options: write to system-wide [1m$[22m([1mprefix[22m)[1m/etc/gitconfig[0m
           rather than the repository [1m.git/config[22m.

           For reading options: read only from system-wide
           [1m$[22m([1mprefix[22m)[1m/etc/gitconfig [22mrather than from all available files.

           See also the section called “FILES”.

       --local
           For writing options: write to the repository [1m.git/config [22mfile. This
           is the default behavior.

           For reading options: read only from the repository [1m.git/config[0m
           rather than from all available files.

           See also the section called “FILES”.

       --worktree
           Similar to [1m--local [22mexcept that [1m$GIT_DIR/config.worktree [22mis read from
           or written to if [1mextensions.worktreeConfig [22mis enabled. If not it’s
           the same as [1m--local[22m. Note that [1m$GIT_DIR [22mis equal to [1m$GIT_COMMON_DIR[0m
           for the main working tree, but is of the form
           [1m$GIT_DIR/worktrees/[4m[22m<id>[24m[1m/ [22mfor other working trees. See [1mgit-[0m
           [1mworktree[22m(1) to learn how to enable [1mextensions.worktreeConfig[22m.

       -f <config-file>, --file <config-file>
           For writing options: write to the specified file rather than the
           repository [1m.git/config[22m.

           For reading options: read only from the specified file rather than
           from all available files.

           See also the section called “FILES”.

       --blob <blob>
           Similar to [1m--file [22mbut use the given blob instead of a file. E.g. you
           can use [4mmaster:.gitmodules[24m to read values from the file [4m.gitmodules[0m
           in the master branch. See "SPECIFYING REVISIONS" section in
           [1mgitrevisions[22m(7) for a more complete list of ways to spell blob
           names.

       [1m--value=[4m[22m<pattern>[24m, [1m--no-value[0m
           With [1mget[22m, [1mset[22m, and [1munset[22m, match only against [4m<pattern>[24m. The pattern
           is an extended regular expression unless [1m--fixed-value [22mis given.

           Use [1m--no-value [22mto unset [4m<pattern>[24m.

       --fixed-value
           When used with [1m--value=[4m[22m<pattern>[24m, treat [4m<pattern>[24m as an exact string
           instead of a regular expression. This will restrict the name/value
           pairs that are matched to only those where the value is exactly
           equal to [4m<pattern>[24m.

       --type <type>
           [4mgit[24m [4mconfig[24m will ensure that any input or output is valid under the
           given type constraint(s), and will canonicalize outgoing values in
           [4m<type>[24m's canonical form.

           Valid [4m<type>[24m's include:

           •   [4mbool[24m: canonicalize values [1mtrue[22m, [1myes[22m,[1mon[22m, and positive numbers as
               "true", and values [1mfalse[22m, [1mno[22m, [1moff [22mand [1m0 [22mas "false".

           •   [4mint[24m: canonicalize values as simple decimal numbers. An optional
               suffix of [4mk[24m, [4mm[24m, or [4mg[24m will cause the value to be multiplied by
               1024, 1048576, or 1073741824 upon input.

           •   [4mbool-or-int[24m: canonicalize according to either [4mbool[24m or [4mint[24m, as
               described above.

           •   [4mpath[24m: canonicalize by expanding a leading [1m~ [22mto the value of
               [1m$HOME [22mand [1m~user [22mto the home directory for the specified user.
               This specifier has no effect when setting the value (but you can
               use [1mgit config section.variable ~/ [22mfrom the command line to let
               your shell do the expansion.)

           •   [4mexpiry-date[24m: canonicalize by converting from a fixed or relative
               date-string to a timestamp. This specifier has no effect when
               setting the value.

           •   [4mcolor[24m: When getting a value, canonicalize by converting to an
               ANSI color escape sequence. When setting a value, a sanity-check
               is performed to ensure that the given value is canonicalize-able
               as an ANSI color, but it is written as-is.

       --bool, --int, --bool-or-int, --path, --expiry-date
           Historical options for selecting a type specifier. Prefer instead
           [1m--type [22m(see above).

       --no-type
           Un-sets the previously set type specifier (if one was previously
           set). This option requests that [4mgit[24m [4mconfig[24m not canonicalize the
           retrieved variable.  [1m--no-type [22mhas no effect without [1m--type=[4m[22m<type>[0m
           or [1m--[4m[22m<type>[24m.

       -z, --null
           For all options that output values and/or keys, always end values
           with the null character (instead of a newline). Use newline instead
           as a delimiter between key and value. This allows for secure parsing
           of the output without getting confused e.g. by values that contain
           line breaks.

       --name-only
           Output only the names of config variables for [1mlist [22mor [1mget[22m.

       [1m--show-names[22m, [1m--no-show-names[0m
           With [1mget[22m, show config keys in addition to their values. The default
           is [1m--no-show-names [22munless [1m--url [22mis given and there are no
           subsections in [4m<name>[24m.

       --show-origin
           Augment the output of all queried config options with the origin
           type (file, standard input, blob, command line) and the actual
           origin (config file path, ref, or blob id if applicable).

       --show-scope
           Similar to [1m--show-origin [22min that it augments the output of all
           queried config options with the scope of that value (worktree,
           local, global, system, command).

       --get-colorbool <name> [<stdout-is-tty>]
           Find the color setting for [4m<name>[24m (e.g.  [1mcolor.diff[22m) and output
           "true" or "false".  [4m<stdout-is-tty>[24m should be either "true" or
           "false", and is taken into account when configuration says "auto".
           If [4m<stdout-is-tty>[24m is missing, then checks the standard output of
           the command itself, and exits with status 0 if color is to be used,
           or exits with status 1 otherwise. When the color setting for [1mname [22mis
           undefined, the command uses [1mcolor.ui [22mas fallback.

       --[no-]includes
           Respect [1minclude.*  [22mdirectives in config files when looking up
           values. Defaults to [1moff [22mwhen a specific file is given (e.g., using
           [1m--file[22m, [1m--global[22m, etc) and [1mon [22mwhen searching all config files.

       --default <value>
           When using [1mget[22m, and the requested variable is not found, behave as
           if <value> were the value assigned to that variable.

[1mDEPRECATED MODES[0m

       By default, [4mgit[24m [4mconfig[24m will read configuration options from multiple
       files:

       $(prefix)/etc/gitconfig
           System-wide configuration file.

       $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/config, ~/.gitconfig
           User-specific configuration files. When the XDG_CONFIG_HOME
           environment variable is not set or empty, $HOME/.config/ is used as
           $XDG_CONFIG_HOME.

           These are also called "global" configuration files. If both files
           exist, both files are read in the order given above.

       $GIT_DIR/config
           Repository specific configuration file.

       $GIT_DIR/config.worktree
           This is optional and is only searched when [1mextensions.worktreeConfig[0m
           is present in $GIT_DIR/config.

       You may also provide additional configuration parameters when running
       any git command by using the [1m-c [22moption. See [1mgit[22m(1) for details.

       Options will be read from all of these files that are available. If the
       global or the system-wide configuration files are missing or unreadable
       they will be ignored. If the repository configuration file is missing or
       unreadable, [4mgit[24m [4mconfig[24m will exit with a non-zero error code. An error
       message is produced if the file is unreadable, but not if it is missing.

       The files are read in the order given above, with last value found
       taking precedence over values read earlier. When multiple values are
       taken then all values of a key from all files will be used.

       By default, options are only written to the repository specific
       configuration file. Note that this also affects options like [1mset [22mand
       [1munset[22m. [4mgit[24m [4mconfig[24m [1mwill only ever change one file at a time[22m.

       You can limit which configuration sources are read from or written to by
       specifying the path of a file with the [1m--file [22moption, or by specifying a
       configuration scope with [1m--system[22m, [1m--global[22m, [1m--local[22m, or [1m--worktree[22m. For
       more, see the section called “OPTIONS” above.

[1mSCOPES[0m
       Each configuration source falls within a configuration scope. The scopes
       are:

       system
           $(prefix)/etc/gitconfig

       global
           $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/config

           ~/.gitconfig

       local
           $GIT_DIR/config

       worktree
           $GIT_DIR/config.worktree

       command
           GIT_CONFIG_{COUNT,KEY,VALUE} environment variables (see the section
           called “ENVIRONMENT” below)

           the [1m-c [22moption

       With the exception of [4mcommand[24m, each scope corresponds to a command line
       option: [1m--system[22m, [1m--global[22m, [1m--local[22m, [1m--worktree[22m.

       When reading options, specifying a scope will only read options from the
       files within that scope. When writing options, specifying a scope will
       write to the files within that scope (instead of the repository specific
       configuration file). See the section called “OPTIONS” above for a
       complete description.

       Most configuration options are respected regardless of the scope it is
       defined in, but some options are only respected in certain scopes. See
       the respective option’s documentation for the full details.

   [1mProtected configuration[0m
       Protected configuration refers to the [4msystem[24m, [4mglobal[24m, and [4mcommand[0m
       scopes. For security reasons, certain options are only respected when
       they are specified in protected configuration, and ignored otherwise.

       Git treats these scopes as if they are controlled by the user or a
       trusted administrator. This is because an attacker who controls these
       scopes can do substantial harm without using Git, so it is assumed that
       the user’s environment protects these scopes against attackers.

[1mENVIRONMENT[0m
       GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL, GIT_CONFIG_SYSTEM
           Take the configuration from the given files instead from global or
           system-level configuration. See [1mgit[22m(1) for details.

       GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM
           Whether to skip reading settings from the system-wide
           $(prefix)/etc/gitconfig file. See [1mgit[22m(1) for details.

       See also the section called “FILES”.

       GIT_CONFIG_COUNT, GIT_CONFIG_KEY_<n>, GIT_CONFIG_VALUE_<n>
           If GIT_CONFIG_COUNT is set to a positive number, all environment
           pairs GIT_CONFIG_KEY_<n> and GIT_CONFIG_VALUE_<n> up to that number
           will be added to the process’s runtime configuration. The config
           pairs are zero-indexed. Any missing key or value is treated as an
           error. An empty GIT_CONFIG_COUNT is treated the same as
           GIT_CONFIG_COUNT=0, namely no pairs are processed. These environment
           variables will override values in configuration files, but will be
           overridden by any explicit options passed via [1mgit -c[22m.

           This is useful for cases where you want to spawn multiple git
           commands with a common configuration but cannot depend on a
           configuration file, for example when writing scripts.

       GIT_CONFIG
           If no [1m--file [22moption is provided to [1mgit config[22m, use the file given by
           [1mGIT_CONFIG [22mas if it were provided via [1m--file[22m. This variable has no
           effect on other Git commands, and is mostly for historical
           compatibility; there is generally no reason to use it instead of the
           [1m--file [22moption.

[1mEXAMPLES[0m
       Given a .git/config like this:

           #
           # This is the config file, and
           # a '#' or ';' character indicates
           # a comment
           #

           ; core variables
           [core]
                   ; Don't trust file modes
                   filemode = false

           ; Our diff algorithm
           [diff]
                   external = /usr/local/bin/diff-wrapper
                   renames = true

           ; Proxy settings
           [core]
                   gitproxy=proxy-command for kernel.org
                   gitproxy=default-proxy ; for all the rest

           ; HTTP
           [http]
                   sslVerify
           [http "https://weak.example.com"]
                   sslVerify = false
                   cookieFile = /tmp/cookie.txt

       you can set the filemode to true with

           % git config set core.filemode true

       The hypothetical proxy command entries actually have a postfix to
       discern what URL they apply to. Here is how to change the entry for
       kernel.org to "ssh".

           % git config set --value='for kernel.org$' core.gitproxy '"ssh" for kernel.org'

       This makes sure that only the key/value pair for kernel.org is replaced.

       To delete the entry for renames, do

           % git config unset diff.renames

       If you want to delete an entry for a multivar (like core.gitproxy
       above), you have to provide a regex matching the value of exactly one
       line.

       To query the value for a given key, do

           % git config get core.filemode

       or, to query a multivar:

           % git config get --value="for kernel.org$" core.gitproxy

       If you want to know all the values for a multivar, do:

           % git config get --all --show-names core.gitproxy

       If you like to live dangerously, you can replace [1mall [22mcore.gitproxy by a
       new one with

           % git config set --all core.gitproxy ssh

       However, if you really only want to replace the line for the default
       proxy, i.e. the one without a "for ..." postfix, do something like this:

           % git config set --value='! for ' core.gitproxy ssh

       To actually match only values with an exclamation mark, you have to

           % git config set --value='[!]' section.key value

       To add a new proxy, without altering any of the existing ones, use

           % git config set --append core.gitproxy '"proxy-command" for example.com'

       An example to use customized color from the configuration in your
       script:

           #!/bin/sh
           WS=$(git config get --type=color --default="blue reverse" color.diff.whitespace)
           RESET=$(git config get --type=color --default="reset" "")
           echo "${WS}your whitespace color or blue reverse${RESET}"

       For URLs in [1mhttps://weak.example.com[22m, [1mhttp.sslVerify [22mis set to false,
       while it is set to [1mtrue [22mfor all others:

           % git config get --type=bool --url=https://good.example.com http.sslverify
           true
           % git config get --type=bool --url=https://weak.example.com http.sslverify
           false
           % git config get --url=https://weak.example.com http
           http.cookieFile /tmp/cookie.txt
           http.sslverify false

[1mCONFIGURATION FILE[0m
       The Git configuration file contains a number of variables that affect
       the Git commands' behavior. The files [1m.git/config [22mand optionally
       [1mconfig.worktree [22m(see the "CONFIGURATION FILE" section of [1mgit-[0m
       [1mworktree[22m(1)) in each repository are used to store the configuration for
       that repository, and [1m$HOME/.gitconfig [22mis used to store a per-user
       configuration as fallback values for the [1m.git/config [22mfile. The file
       [1m/etc/gitconfig [22mcan be used to store a system-wide default configuration.

       The configuration variables are used by both the Git plumbing and the
       porcelain commands. The variables are divided into sections, wherein the
       fully qualified variable name of the variable itself is the last
       dot-separated segment and the section name is everything before the last
       dot. The variable names are case-insensitive, allow only alphanumeric
       characters and [1m-[22m, and must start with an alphabetic character. Some
       variables may appear multiple times; we say then that the variable is
       multivalued.

   [1mSyntax[0m
       The syntax is fairly flexible and permissive. Whitespace characters,
       which in this context are the space character (SP) and the horizontal
       tabulation (HT), are mostly ignored. The [4m#[24m and [4m;[24m characters begin
       comments to the end of line. Blank lines are ignored.

       The file consists of sections and variables. A section begins with the
       name of the section in square brackets and continues until the next
       section begins. Section names are case-insensitive. Only alphanumeric
       characters, [1m- [22mand . are allowed in section names. Each variable must
       belong to some section, which means that there must be a section header
       before the first setting of a variable.

       Sections can be further divided into subsections. To begin a subsection
       put its name in double quotes, separated by space from the section name,
       in the section header, like in the example below:

                   [section "subsection"]

       Subsection names are case sensitive and can contain any characters
       except newline and the null byte. Doublequote " and backslash can be
       included by escaping them as [1m\[22m" and [1m\\[22m, respectively. Backslashes
       preceding other characters are dropped when reading; for example, [1m\t [22mis
       read as [1mt [22mand [1m\0 [22mis read as [1m0[22m. Section headers cannot span multiple
       lines. Variables may belong directly to a section or to a given
       subsection. You can have [[1msection[22m] if you have [[1msection [22m"subsection"],
       but you don’t need to.

       There is also a deprecated [[1msection.subsection[22m] syntax. With this
       syntax, the subsection name is converted to lower-case and is also
       compared case sensitively. These subsection names follow the same
       restrictions as section names.

       All the other lines (and the remainder of the line after the section
       header) are recognized as setting variables, in the form [4mname[24m [4m=[24m [4mvalue[0m
       (or just [4mname[24m, which is a short-hand to say that the variable is the
       boolean "true"). The variable names are case-insensitive, allow only
       alphanumeric characters and [1m-[22m, and must start with an alphabetic
       character.

       Whitespace characters surrounding [1mname[22m, [1m= [22mand [1mvalue [22mare discarded.
       Internal whitespace characters within [4mvalue[24m are retained verbatim.
       Comments starting with either # or ; and extending to the end of line
       are discarded. A line that defines a value can be continued to the next
       line by ending it with a backslash ([1m\[22m); the backslash and the
       end-of-line characters are discarded.

       If [1mvalue [22mneeds to contain leading or trailing whitespace characters, it
       must be enclosed in double quotation marks ("). Inside double quotation
       marks, double quote (") and backslash ([1m\[22m) characters must be escaped:
       use [1m\[22m" for " and [1m\\ [22mfor [1m\[22m.

       The following escape sequences (beside [1m\[22m" and [1m\\[22m) are recognized: [1m\n [22mfor
       newline character (NL), [1m\t [22mfor horizontal tabulation (HT, TAB) and [1m\b[0m
       for backspace (BS). Other char escape sequences (including octal escape
       sequences) are invalid.

   [1mIncludes[0m
       The [1minclude [22mand [1mincludeIf [22msections allow you to include config
       directives from another source. These sections behave identically to
       each other with the exception that [1mincludeIf [22msections may be ignored if
       their condition does not evaluate to true; see "Conditional includes"
       below.

       You can include a config file from another by setting the special
       [1minclude.path [22m(or [1mincludeIf.*.path[22m) variable to the name of the file to
       be included. The variable takes a pathname as its value, and is subject
       to tilde expansion. These variables can be given multiple times.

       The contents of the included file are inserted immediately, as if they
       had been found at the location of the include directive. If the value of
       the variable is a relative path, the path is considered to be relative
       to the configuration file in which the include directive was found. See
       below for examples.

   [1mConditional includes[0m
       You can conditionally include a config file from another by setting an
       [1mincludeIf.[4m[22m<condition>[24m[1m.path [22mvariable to the name of the file to be
       included.

       The condition starts with a keyword followed by a colon and some data
       whose format and meaning depends on the keyword. Supported keywords are:

       [1mgitdir[0m
           The data that follows the keyword [1mgitdir: [22mis used as a glob pattern.
           If the location of the .git directory matches the pattern, the
           include condition is met.

           The .git location may be auto-discovered, or come from [1m$GIT_DIR[0m
           environment variable. If the repository is auto-discovered via a
           .git file (e.g. from submodules, or a linked worktree), the .git
           location would be the final location where the .git directory is,
           not where the .git file is.

           The pattern can contain standard globbing wildcards and two
           additional ones, [1m**/ [22mand [1m/**[22m, that can match multiple path
           components. Please refer to [1mgitignore[22m(5) for details. For
           convenience:

           •   If the pattern starts with [1m~/[22m, [1m~ [22mwill be substituted with the
               content of the environment variable [1mHOME[22m.

           •   If the pattern starts with [1m./[22m, it is replaced with the directory
               containing the current config file.

           •   If the pattern does not start with either [1m~/[22m, [1m./ [22mor [1m/[22m, [1m**/ [22mwill
               be automatically prepended. For example, the pattern [1mfoo/bar[0m
               becomes [1m**/foo/bar [22mand would match [1m/any/path/to/foo/bar[22m.

           •   If the pattern ends with [1m/[22m, [1m** [22mwill be automatically added. For
               example, the pattern [1mfoo/ [22mbecomes [1mfoo/**[22m. In other words, it
               matches "foo" and everything inside, recursively.

       [1mgitdir/i[0m
           This is the same as [1mgitdir [22mexcept that matching is done
           case-insensitively (e.g. on case-insensitive file systems)

       [1monbranch[0m
           The data that follows the keyword [1monbranch: [22mis taken to be a pattern
           with standard globbing wildcards and two additional ones, [1m**/ [22mand
           [1m/**[22m, that can match multiple path components. If we are in a
           worktree where the name of the branch that is currently checked out
           matches the pattern, the include condition is met.

           If the pattern ends with [1m/[22m, [1m** [22mwill be automatically added. For
           example, the pattern [1mfoo/ [22mbecomes [1mfoo/**[22m. In other words, it matches
           all branches that begin with [1mfoo/[22m. This is useful if your branches
           are organized hierarchically and you would like to apply a
           configuration to all the branches in that hierarchy.

       [1mhasconfig:remote.*.url:[0m
           The data that follows this keyword is taken to be a pattern with
           standard globbing wildcards and two additional ones, [1m**/ [22mand [1m/**[22m,
           that can match multiple components. The first time this keyword is
           seen, the rest of the config files will be scanned for remote URLs
           (without applying any values). If there exists at least one remote
           URL that matches this pattern, the include condition is met.

           Files included by this option (directly or indirectly) are not
           allowed to contain remote URLs.

           Note that unlike other includeIf conditions, resolving this
           condition relies on information that is not yet known at the point
           of reading the condition. A typical use case is this option being
           present as a system-level or global-level config, and the remote URL
           being in a local-level config; hence the need to scan ahead when
           resolving this condition. In order to avoid the chicken-and-egg
           problem in which potentially-included files can affect whether such
           files are potentially included, Git breaks the cycle by prohibiting
           these files from affecting the resolution of these conditions (thus,
           prohibiting them from declaring remote URLs).

           As for the naming of this keyword, it is for forwards compatibility
           with a naming scheme that supports more variable-based include
           conditions, but currently Git only supports the exact keyword
           described above.

       A few more notes on matching via [1mgitdir [22mand [1mgitdir/i[22m:

       •   Symlinks in [1m$GIT_DIR [22mare not resolved before matching.

       •   Both the symlink & realpath versions of paths will be matched
           outside of [1m$GIT_DIR[22m. E.g. if ~/git is a symlink to /mnt/storage/git,
           both [1mgitdir:~/git [22mand [1mgitdir:/mnt/storage/git [22mwill match.

           This was not the case in the initial release of this feature in
           v2.13.0, which only matched the realpath version. Configuration that
           wants to be compatible with the initial release of this feature
           needs to either specify only the realpath version, or both versions.

       •   Note that "../" is not special and will match literally, which is
           unlikely what you want.

   [1mValues[0m
       Values of many variables are treated as a simple string, but there are
       variables that take values of specific types and there are rules as to
       how to spell them.

       boolean
           When a variable is said to take a boolean value, many synonyms are
           accepted for [4mtrue[24m and [4mfalse[24m; these are all case-insensitive.

           true
               Boolean true literals are [1myes[22m, [1mon[22m, [1mtrue[22m, and [1m1[22m. Also, a variable
               defined without [1m= [4m[22m<value>[24m is taken as true.

           false
               Boolean false literals are [1mno[22m, [1moff[22m, [1mfalse[22m, [1m0 [22mand the empty
               string.

               When converting a value to its canonical form using the
               [1m--type=bool [22mtype specifier, [4mgit[24m [4mconfig[24m will ensure that the
               output is "true" or "false" (spelled in lowercase).

       integer
           The value for many variables that specify various sizes can be
           suffixed with [1mk[22m, [1mM[22m,... to mean "scale the number by 1024", "by
           1024x1024", etc.

       color
           The value for a variable that takes a color is a list of colors (at
           most two, one for foreground and one for background) and attributes
           (as many as you want), separated by spaces.

           The basic colors accepted are [1mnormal[22m, [1mblack[22m, [1mred[22m, [1mgreen[22m, [1myellow[22m,
           [1mblue[22m, [1mmagenta[22m, [1mcyan[22m, [1mwhite [22mand [1mdefault[22m. The first color given is the
           foreground; the second is the background. All the basic colors
           except [1mnormal [22mand [1mdefault [22mhave a bright variant that can be
           specified by prefixing the color with [1mbright[22m, like [1mbrightred[22m.

           The color [1mnormal [22mmakes no change to the color. It is the same as an
           empty string, but can be used as the foreground color when
           specifying a background color alone (for example, "normal red").

           The color [1mdefault [22mexplicitly resets the color to the terminal
           default, for example to specify a cleared background. Although it
           varies between terminals, this is usually not the same as setting to
           "white black".

           Colors may also be given as numbers between 0 and 255; these use
           ANSI 256-color mode (but note that not all terminals may support
           this). If your terminal supports it, you may also specify 24-bit RGB
           values as hex, like #ff0ab3, or 12-bit RGB values like #f1b, which
           is equivalent to the 24-bit color #ff11bb.

           The accepted attributes are [1mbold[22m, [1mdim[22m, [1mul[22m, [1mblink[22m, [1mreverse[22m, [1mitalic[22m,
           and [1mstrike [22m(for crossed-out or "strikethrough" letters). The
           position of any attributes with respect to the colors (before,
           after, or in between), doesn’t matter. Specific attributes may be
           turned off by prefixing them with [1mno [22mor [1mno- [22m(e.g., [1mnoreverse[22m, [1mno-ul[22m,
           etc).

           The pseudo-attribute [1mreset [22mresets all colors and attributes before
           applying the specified coloring. For example, [1mreset green [22mwill
           result in a green foreground and default background without any
           active attributes.

           An empty color string produces no color effect at all. This can be
           used to avoid coloring specific elements without disabling color
           entirely.

           For git’s pre-defined color slots, the attributes are meant to be
           reset at the beginning of each item in the colored output. So
           setting [1mcolor.decorate.branch [22mto [1mblack [22mwill paint that branch name
           in a plain [1mblack[22m, even if the previous thing on the same output line
           (e.g. opening parenthesis before the list of branch names in [1mlog[0m
           [1m--decorate [22moutput) is set to be painted with [1mbold [22mor some other
           attribute. However, custom log formats may do more complicated and
           layered coloring, and the negated forms may be useful there.

       pathname
           A variable that takes a pathname value can be given a string that
           begins with "[1m~/[22m" or "[1m~user/[22m", and the usual tilde expansion happens
           to such a string: [1m~/ [22mis expanded to the value of [1m$HOME[22m, and [1m~user/[0m
           to the specified user’s home directory.

           If a path starts with [1m%[22m([1mprefix[22m)[1m/[22m, the remainder is interpreted as a
           path relative to Git’s "runtime prefix", i.e. relative to the
           location where Git itself was installed. For example, [1m%[22m([1mprefix[22m)[1m/bin/[0m
           refers to the directory in which the Git executable itself lives. If
           Git was compiled without runtime prefix support, the compiled-in
           prefix will be substituted instead. In the unlikely event that a
           literal path needs to be specified that should [4mnot[24m be expanded, it
           needs to be prefixed by [1m./[22m, like so: [1m./%[22m([1mprefix[22m)[1m/bin[22m.

   [1mVariables[0m
       Note that this list is non-comprehensive and not necessarily complete.
       For command-specific variables, you will find a more detailed
       description in the appropriate manual page.

       Other git-related tools may and do use their own variables. When
       inventing new variables for use in your own tool, make sure their names
       do not conflict with those that are used by Git itself and other popular
       tools, and describe them in your documentation.

       [1madd.ignoreErrors[22m, [1madd.ignore-errors [22m(deprecated)
           Tells [1mgit add [22mto continue adding files when some files cannot be
           added due to indexing errors. Equivalent to the [1m--ignore-errors[0m
           option of [1mgit-add[22m(1).  [1madd.ignore-errors [22mis deprecated, as it does
           not follow the usual naming convention for configuration variables.

       advice.*
           These variables control various optional help messages designed to
           aid new users. When left unconfigured, Git will give the message
           alongside instructions on how to squelch it. You can tell Git that
           you have understood the issue and no longer need a specific help
           message by setting the corresponding variable to [1mfalse[22m.

           As they are intended to help human users, these messages are output
           to the standard error. When tools that run Git as a subprocess find
           them disruptive, they can set [1mGIT_ADVICE=0 [22min the environment to
           squelch all advice messages.

           addEmbeddedRepo
               Shown when the user accidentally adds one git repo inside of
               another.

           addEmptyPathspec
               Shown when the user runs [1mgit add [22mwithout providing the pathspec
               parameter.

           addIgnoredFile
               Shown when the user attempts to add an ignored file to the
               index.

           amWorkDir

               user the location of the file.

           ambiguousFetchRefspec
               Shown when a fetch refspec for multiple remotes maps to the same
               remote-tracking branch namespace and causes branch tracking
               set-up to fail.

           checkoutAmbiguousRemoteBranchName
               Shown when the argument to [1mgit-checkout[22m(1) and [1mgit-switch[22m(1)
               ambiguously resolves to a remote tracking branch on more than
               one remote in situations where an unambiguous argument would
               have otherwise caused a remote-tracking branch to be checked
               out. See the [1mcheckout.defaultRemote [22mconfiguration variable for
               how to set a given remote to be used by default in some
               situations where this advice would be printed.

           commitBeforeMerge
               Shown when [1mgit-merge[22m(1) refuses to merge to avoid overwriting
               local changes.

           detachedHead
               Shown when the user uses [1mgit-switch[22m(1) or [1mgit-checkout[22m(1) to
               move to the detached HEAD state, to tell the user how to create
               a local branch after the fact.

           diverging
               Shown when a fast-forward is not possible.

           fetchShowForcedUpdates
               Shown when [1mgit-fetch[22m(1) takes a long time to calculate forced
               updates after ref updates, or to warn that the check is
               disabled.

           forceDeleteBranch
               Shown when the user tries to delete a not fully merged branch
               without the force option set.

           ignoredHook
               Shown when a hook is ignored because the hook is not set as
               executable.

           implicitIdentity
               Shown when the user’s information is guessed from the system
               username and domain name, to tell the user how to set their
               identity configuration.

           mergeConflict
               Shown when various commands stop because of conflicts.

               Shown when a user attempts to recursively tag a tag object.

           pushAlreadyExists
               Shown when [1mgit-push[22m(1) rejects an update that does not qualify
               for fast-forwarding (e.g., a tag.)

           pushFetchFirst
               Shown when [1mgit-push[22m(1) rejects an update that tries to overwrite
               a remote ref that points at an object we do not have.

           pushNeedsForce
               Shown when [1mgit-push[22m(1) rejects an update that tries to overwrite
               a remote ref that points at an object that is not a commit-ish,
               or make the remote ref point at an object that is not a
               commit-ish.

           pushNonFFCurrent
               Shown when [1mgit-push[22m(1) fails due to a non-fast-forward update to
               the current branch.

           pushNonFFMatching
               Shown when the user ran [1mgit-push[22m(1) and pushed "matching refs"
               explicitly (i.e. used [1m:[22m, or specified a refspec that isn’t the
               current branch) and it resulted in a non-fast-forward error.

           pushRefNeedsUpdate
               Shown when [1mgit-push[22m(1) rejects a forced update of a branch when
               its remote-tracking ref has updates that we do not have locally.

           pushUnqualifiedRefname
               Shown when [1mgit-push[22m(1) gives up trying to guess based on the
               source and destination refs what remote ref namespace the source
               belongs in, but where we can still suggest that the user push to
               either [1mrefs/heads/* [22mor [1mrefs/tags/* [22mbased on the type of the
               source object.

           pushUpdateRejected
               Set this variable to [1mfalse [22mif you want to disable

               Shown when there is an error after editing the rebase todo list.

           refSyntax
               Shown when the user provides an illegal ref name, to tell the
               user about the ref syntax documentation.

           resetNoRefresh
               Shown when [1mgit-reset[22m(1) takes more than 2 seconds to refresh the
               index after reset, to tell the user that they can use the
               [1m--no-refresh [22moption.

           resolveConflict
               Shown by various commands when conflicts prevent the operation
               from being performed.

           rmHints
               Shown on failure in the output of [1mgit-rm[22m(1), to give directions
               on how to proceed from the current state.

           sequencerInUse
               Shown when a sequencer command is already in progress.

           skippedCherryPicks
               Shown when [1mgit-rebase[22m(1) skips a commit that has already been
               cherry-picked onto the upstream branch.

           sparseIndexExpanded
               Shown when a sparse index is expanded to a full index, which is
               likely due to an unexpected set of files existing outside of the
               sparse-checkout.

           statusAheadBehind
               Shown when [1mgit-status[22m(1) computes the ahead/behind counts for a
               local ref compared to its remote tracking ref, and that
               calculation takes longer than expected. Will not appear if
               [1mstatus.aheadBehind [22mis false or the option [1m--no-ahead-behind [22mis
               given.

           statusHints
               Show directions on how to proceed from the current state in the
               output of [1mgit-status[22m(1), in the template shown when writing
               commit messages in [1mgit-commit[22m(1), and in the help message shown
               by [1mgit-switch[22m(1) or [1mgit-checkout[22m(1) when switching branches.

           statusUoption
               Shown when [1mgit-status[22m(1) takes more than 2 seconds to enumerate
               untracked files, to tell the user that they can use the [1m-u[0m
               option.

           submoduleAlternateErrorStrategyDie
               Shown when a submodule.alternateErrorStrategy option configured
               to "die" causes a fatal error.

           submoduleMergeConflict
               Advice shown when a non-trivial submodule merge conflict is
               encountered.

           submodulesNotUpdated
               Shown when a user runs a submodule command that fails because
               [1mgit submodule update --init [22mwas not run.

           suggestDetachingHead
               Shown when [1mgit-switch[22m(1) refuses to detach HEAD without the
               explicit [1m--detach [22moption.

           updateSparsePath
               Shown when either [1mgit-add[22m(1) or [1mgit-rm[22m(1) is asked to update
               index entries outside the current sparse checkout.

           waitingForEditor
               Shown when Git is waiting for editor input. Relevant when e.g.
               the editor is not launched inside the terminal.

           worktreeAddOrphan
               Shown when the user tries to create a worktree from an invalid
               reference, to tell the user how to create a new unborn branch
               instead.

       alias.*
           Command aliases for the [1mgit[22m(1) command wrapper - e.g. after defining
           [1malias.last = cat-file commit HEAD[22m, the invocation [1mgit last [22mis
           equivalent to [1mgit cat-file commit HEAD[22m. To avoid confusion and
           troubles with script usage, aliases that hide existing Git commands
           are ignored. Arguments are split by spaces, the usual shell quoting
           and escaping are supported. A quote pair or a backslash can be used
           to quote them.

           Note that the first word of an alias does not necessarily have to be
           a command. It can be a command-line option that will be passed into
           the invocation of [1mgit[22m. In particular, this is useful when used with
           [1m-c [22mto pass in one-time configurations or [1m-p [22mto force pagination. For
           example, [1mloud-rebase = -c commit.verbose=true rebase [22mcan be defined
           such that running [1mgit loud-rebase [22mwould be equivalent to [1mgit -c[0m
           [1mcommit.verbose=true rebase[22m. Also, [1mps = -p status [22mwould be a helpful
           alias since [1mgit ps [22mwould paginate the output of [1mgit status [22mwhere the
           original command does not.

           If the alias expansion is prefixed with an exclamation point, it
           will be treated as a shell command. For example, defining [1malias.new[0m
           [1m= [22m!gitk [1m--all --not ORIG_HEAD[22m, the invocation [1mgit new [22mis equivalent
           to running the shell command [1mgitk --all --not ORIG_HEAD[22m. Note:

           •   Shell commands will be executed from the top-level directory of
               a repository, which may not necessarily be the current
               directory.

           •   [1mGIT_PREFIX [22mis set as returned by running [1mgit rev-parse[0m
               [1m--show-prefix [22mfrom the original current directory. See [1mgit-rev-[0m
               [1mparse[22m(1).

           •   Shell command aliases always receive any extra arguments
               provided to the Git command-line as positional arguments.

               •   Care should be taken if your shell alias is a "one-liner"
                   script with multiple commands (e.g. in a pipeline),
                   references multiple arguments, or is otherwise not able to
                   handle positional arguments added at the end. For example:
                   [1malias.cmd = [22m"!echo [1m$1 [22m| [1mgrep $2[22m" called as [1mgit cmd 1 2 [22mwill
                   be executed as [4mecho[24m [4m$1[24m [4m|[24m [4mgrep[24m [4m$2[24m [4m1[24m [4m2[24m, which is not what you
                   want.

               •   A convenient way to deal with this is to write your script
                   operations in an inline function that is then called with
                   any arguments from the command-line. For example `alias.cmd
                   = "!c() { echo $1 | grep $2 ; }; c" will correctly execute
                   the prior example.

               •   Setting [1mGIT_TRACE=1 [22mcan help you debug the command being run
                   for your alias.

       am.keepcr
           If true, git-am will call git-mailsplit for patches in mbox format
           with parameter [1m--keep-cr[22m. In this case git-mailsplit will not remove
           [1m\r [22mfrom lines ending with [1m\r\n[22m. Can be overridden by giving
           [1m--no-keep-cr [22mfrom the command line. See [1mgit-am[22m(1), [1mgit-mailsplit[22m(1).

       am.threeWay
           By default, [1mgit am [22mwill fail if the patch does not apply cleanly.
           When set to true, this setting tells [1mgit am [22mto fall back on 3-way
           merge if the patch records the identity of blobs it is supposed to
           apply to and we have those blobs available locally (equivalent to
           giving the [1m--3way [22moption from the command line). Defaults to [1mfalse[22m.
           See [1mgit-am[22m(1).

       apply.ignoreWhitespace
           When set to [4mchange[24m, tells [4mgit[24m [4mapply[24m to ignore changes in whitespace,
           in the same way as the [1m--ignore-space-change [22moption. When set to one
           of: no, none, never, false, it tells [4mgit[24m [4mapply[24m to respect all
           whitespace differences. See [1mgit-apply[22m(1).

       apply.whitespace
           Tells [4mgit[24m [4mapply[24m how to handle whitespace, in the same way as the
           [1m--whitespace [22moption. See [1mgit-apply[22m(1).

       attr.tree
           A reference to a tree in the repository from which to read
           attributes, instead of the [1m.gitattributes [22mfile in the working tree.
           If the value does not resolve to a valid tree object, an empty tree
           is used instead. When the [1mGIT_ATTR_SOURCE [22menvironment variable or
           [1m--attr-source [22mcommand line option are used, this configuration
           variable has no effect.

           [1mNote[0m

           The configuration options in [1mbitmapPseudoMerge.* [22mare considered
           EXPERIMENTAL and may be subject to change or be removed entirely in
           the future. For more information about the pseudo-merge bitmap
           feature, see the "Pseudo-merge bitmaps" section of [1mgitpacking[22m(7).

       bitmapPseudoMerge.<name>.pattern
           Regular expression used to match reference names. Commits pointed to
           by references matching this pattern (and meeting the below criteria,
           like [1mbitmapPseudoMerge.[4m[22m<name>[24m[1m.sampleRate [22mand
           [1mbitmapPseudoMerge.[4m[22m<name>[24m[1m.threshold[22m) will be considered for inclusion
           in a pseudo-merge bitmap.

           Commits are grouped into pseudo-merge groups based on whether or not
           any reference(s) that point at a given commit match the pattern,
           which is an extended regular expression.

           Within a pseudo-merge group, commits may be further grouped into
           sub-groups based on the capture groups in the pattern. These
           sub-groupings are formed from the regular expressions by
           concatenating any capture groups from the regular expression, with a
           [4m-[24m dash in between.

           For example, if the pattern is [1mrefs/tags/[22m, then all tags (provided
           they meet the below criteria) will be considered candidates for the
           same pseudo-merge group. However, if the pattern is instead
           [1mrefs/remotes/[22m([[1m0-9[22m])[1m+/tags/[22m, then tags from different remotes will
           be grouped into separate pseudo-merge groups, based on the remote
           number.

       bitmapPseudoMerge.<name>.decay
           Determines the rate at which consecutive pseudo-merge bitmap groups
           decrease in size. Must be non-negative. This parameter can be
           thought of as [1mk [22min the function [1mf[22m([1mn[22m) [1m= C * n^-k[22m, where [1mf[22m([1mn[22m) is the
           size of the `n`th group.

           Setting the decay rate equal to [1m0 [22mwill cause all groups to be the
           same size. Setting the decay rate equal to [1m1 [22mwill cause the [1mn[22m`th
           [1mgroup to be [22m`1/n the size of the initial group. Higher values of the
           decay rate cause consecutive groups to shrink at an increasing rate.
           The default is [1m1[22m.

           If all groups are the same size, it is possible that groups
           containing newer commits will be able to be used less often than
           earlier groups, since it is more likely that the references pointing
           at newer commits will be updated more often than a reference
           pointing at an old commit.

       bitmapPseudoMerge.<name>.sampleRate
           Determines the proportion of non-bitmapped commits (among reference
           tips) which are selected for inclusion in an unstable pseudo-merge
           bitmap. Must be between [1m0 [22mand [1m1 [22m(inclusive). The default is [1m1[22m.

       bitmapPseudoMerge.<name>.threshold
           Determines the minimum age of non-bitmapped commits (among reference
           tips, as above) which are candidates for inclusion in an unstable
           pseudo-merge bitmap. The default is [1m1.week.ago[22m.

       bitmapPseudoMerge.<name>.maxMerges
           Determines the maximum number of pseudo-merge commits among which
           commits may be distributed.

           For pseudo-merge groups whose pattern does not contain any capture
           groups, this setting is applied for all commits matching the regular
           expression. For patterns that have one or more capture groups, this
           setting is applied for each distinct capture group.

           For example, if your capture group is [1mrefs/tags/[22m, then this setting
           will distribute all tags into a maximum of [1mmaxMerges [22mpseudo-merge
           commits. However, if your capture group is, say,
           [1mrefs/remotes/[22m([[1m0-9[22m][1m+[22m)[1m/tags/[22m, then this setting will be applied to
           each remote’s set of tags individually.

           Must be non-negative. The default value is 64.

       bitmapPseudoMerge.<name>.stableThreshold
           Determines the minimum age of commits (among reference tips, as
           above, however stable commits are still considered candidates even
           when they have been covered by a bitmap) which are candidates for a
           stable a pseudo-merge bitmap. The default is [1m1.month.ago[22m.

           Setting this threshold to a smaller value (e.g., 1.week.ago) will
           cause more stable groups to be generated (which impose a one-time
           generation cost) but those groups will likely become stale over
           time. Using a larger value incurs the opposite penalty (fewer stable
           groups which are more useful).

       bitmapPseudoMerge.<name>.stableSize
           Determines the size (in number of commits) of a stable psuedo-merge
           bitmap. The default is [1m512[22m.

       blame.blankBoundary
           Show blank commit object name for boundary commits in [1mgit-blame[22m(1).
           This option defaults to false.

       blame.coloring
           This determines the coloring scheme to be applied to blame output.
           It can be [4mrepeatedLines[24m, [4mhighlightRecent[24m, or [4mnone[24m which is the
           default.

       blame.date
           Specifies the format used to output dates in [1mgit-blame[22m(1). If unset
           the iso format is used. For supported values, see the discussion of
           the [1m--date [22moption at [1mgit-log[22m(1).

       blame.showEmail
           Show the author email instead of author name in [1mgit-blame[22m(1). This
           option defaults to false.

       blame.showRoot
           Do not treat root commits as boundaries in [1mgit-blame[22m(1). This option
           defaults to false.

       blame.ignoreRevsFile
           Ignore revisions listed in the file, one unabbreviated object name
           per line, in [1mgit-blame[22m(1). Whitespace and comments beginning with #
           are ignored. This option may be repeated multiple times. Empty file
           names will reset the list of ignored revisions. This option will be
           handled before the command line option [1m--ignore-revs-file[22m.

       blame.markUnblamableLines
           Mark lines that were changed by an ignored revision that we could
           not attribute to another commit with a [4m*[24m in the output of [1mgit-[0m
           [1mblame[22m(1).

       blame.markIgnoredLines
           Mark lines that were changed by an ignored revision that we
           attributed to another commit with a [4m?[24m  in the output of [1mgit-[0m
           [1mblame[22m(1).

       [1mbranch.autoSetupMerge[0m
           Tells [1mgit branch[22m, [1mgit switch [22mand [1mgit checkout [22mto set up new branches
           so that [1mgit-pull[22m(1) will appropriately merge from the starting point
           branch. Note that even if this option is not set, this behavior can
           be chosen per-branch using the [1m--track [22mand [1m--no-track [22moptions. This
           option defaults to [1mtrue[22m. The valid settings are:

               rebase will be set to true for all tracking branches.

           See [1mbranch.autoSetupMerge [22mfor details on how to set up a branch to
           track another branch. This option defaults to [1mnever[22m.

       [1mbranch.sort[0m
           This variable controls the sort ordering of branches when displayed
           by [1mgit-branch[22m(1). Without the [1m--sort=[4m[22m<value>[24m option provided, the

       [1mbranch.[4m[22m<name>[24m[1m.remote[0m
           When on branch [4m<name>[24m, it tells [1mgit fetch [22mand [1mgit push [22mwhich remote
           to fetch from or push to. The remote to push to may be overridden
           with [1mremote.pushDefault [22m(for all branches). The remote to push to,
           for the current branch, may be further overridden by
           [1mbranch.[4m[22m<name>[24m[1m.pushRemote[22m. If no remote is configured, or if you are
           not on any branch and there is more than one remote defined in the
           repository, it defaults to [1morigin [22mfor fetching and
           [1mremote.pushDefault [22mfor pushing. Additionally, . (a period) is the
           current local repository (a dot-repository), see
           [1mbranch.[4m[22m<name>[24m[1m.merge[22m's final note below.

       [1mbranch.[4m[22m<name>[24m[1m.pushRemote[0m
           When on branch [4m<name>[24m, it overrides [1mbranch.[4m[22m<name>[24m[1m.remote [22mfor
           pushing. It also overrides [1mremote.pushDefault [22mfor pushing from
           branch [4m<name>[24m. When you pull from one place (e.g. your upstream) and
           push to another place (e.g. your own publishing repository), you
           would want to set [1mremote.pushDefault [22mto specify the remote to push
           to for all branches, and use this option to override it for a
           specific branch.

       [1mbranch.[4m[22m<name>[24m[1m.merge[0m
           Defines, together with [1mbranch.[4m[22m<name>[24m[1m.remote[22m, the upstream branch for
           the given branch. It tells [1mgit fetch[22m/[1mgit pull[22m/[1mgit rebase [22mwhich
           branch to merge and can also affect [1mgit push [22m(see [1mpush.default[22m).
           When in branch [4m<name>[24m, it tells [1mgit fetch [22mthe default refspec to be
           marked for merging in [1mFETCH_HEAD[22m. The value is handled like the
           remote part of a refspec, and must match a ref which is fetched from
           the remote given by [1mbranch.[4m[22m<name>[24m[1m.remote[22m. The merge information is
           used by [1mgit pull [22m(which first calls [1mgit fetch[22m) to lookup the default
           branch for merging. Without this option, [1mgit pull [22mdefaults to merge
           the first refspec fetched. Specify multiple values to get an octopus
           merge. If you wish to setup [1mgit pull [22mso that it merges into [4m<name>[0m
           from another branch in the local repository, you can point
           [1mbranch.[4m[22m<name>[24m[1m.merge [22mto the desired branch, and use the relative path
           setting . (a period) for [1mbranch.[4m[22m<name>[24m[1m.remote[22m.

       [1mbranch.[4m[22m<name>[24m[1m.mergeOptions[0m
           Sets default options for merging into branch [4m<name>[24m. The syntax and
           supported options are the same as those of [1mgit-merge[22m(1), but option
           values containing whitespace characters are currently not supported.

       [1mbranch.[4m[22m<name>[24m[1m.rebase[0m
           When true, rebase the branch [4m<name>[24m on top of the fetched branch,
           instead of merging the default branch from the default remote when
           [1mgit pull [22mis run. See [1mpull.rebase [22mfor doing this in a non
           branch-specific manner.

           When [1mmerges [22m(or just [1mm[22m), pass the [1m--rebase-merges [22moption to [1mgit[0m

           When the value is [1minteractive [22m(or just [1mi[22m), the rebase is run in
           interactive mode.

           [1mNOTE[22m: this is a possibly dangerous operation; do [1mnot [22muse it unless

       browser.<tool>.cmd
           Specify the command to invoke the specified browser. The specified
           command is evaluated in shell with the URLs passed as arguments.
           (See [1mgit-web--browse[22m(1).)

       browser.<tool>.path
           Override the path for the given tool that may be used to browse HTML
           help (see [1m-w [22moption in [1mgit-help[22m(1)) or a working repository in
           gitweb (see [1mgit-instaweb[22m(1)).

       bundle.*
           The [1mbundle.*  [22mkeys may appear in a bundle list file found via the
           [1mgit clone --bundle-uri [22moption. These keys currently have no effect
           if placed in a repository config file, though this will change in
           the future. See [34m[1mthe bundle URI design document[0m[1m[22m[1] for more details.

       bundle.version
           This integer value advertises the version of the bundle list format
           used by the bundle list. Currently, the only accepted value is [1m1[22m.

       bundle.mode
           This string value should be either [1mall [22mor [1many[22m. This value describes
           whether all of the advertised bundles are required to unbundle a
           complete understanding of the bundled information ([1mall[22m) or if any
           one of the listed bundle URIs is sufficient ([1many[22m).

       bundle.heuristic
           If this string-valued key exists, then the bundle list is designed
           to work well with incremental [1mgit fetch [22mcommands. The heuristic
           signals that there are additional keys available for each bundle
           that help determine which subset of bundles the client should
           download. The only value currently understood is [1mcreationToken[22m.

       bundle.<id>.*
           The [1mbundle.[4m[22m<id>[24m[1m.*  [22mkeys are used to describe a single item in the
           bundle list, grouped under [4m<id>[24m for identification purposes.

       bundle.<id>.uri
           This string value defines the URI by which Git can reach the
           contents of this [4m<id>[24m. This URI may be a bundle file or another
           bundle list.

       [1mcheckout.defaultRemote[0m
           When you run [1mgit checkout [4m[22m<something>[24m or [1mgit switch [4m[22m<something>[24m and
           only have one remote, it may implicitly fall back on checking out
           and tracking e.g.  [1morigin/[4m[22m<something>[24m. This stops working as soon as
           you have more than one remote with a [4m<something>[24m reference. This
           setting allows for setting the name of a preferred remote that
           should always win when it comes to disambiguation. The typical
           use-case is to set this to [1morigin[22m.

           Currently this is used by [1mgit-switch[22m(1) and [1mgit-checkout[22m(1) when [1mgit[0m
           [1mcheckout [4m[22m<something>[24m or [1mgit switch [4m[22m<something>[24m will checkout the
           [4m<something>[24m branch on another remote, and by [1mgit-worktree[22m(1) when
           [1mgit worktree add [22mrefers to a remote branch. This setting might be
           used for other checkout-like commands or functionality in the
           future.

       [1mcheckout.guess[0m
           Provides the default value for the [1m--guess [22mor [1m--no-guess [22moption in
           [1mgit checkout [22mand [1mgit switch[22m. See [1mgit-switch[22m(1) and [1mgit-checkout[22m(1).

       [1mcheckout.workers[0m
           The number of parallel workers to use when updating the working
           tree. The default is one, i.e. sequential execution. If set to a
           value less than one, Git will use as many workers as the number of
           logical cores available. This setting and
           [1mcheckout.thresholdForParallelism [22maffect all commands that perform
           checkout. E.g. checkout, clone, reset, sparse-checkout, etc.

               [1mNote[0m
               Parallel checkout usually delivers better performance for
               repositories located on SSDs or over NFS. For repositories on
               spinning disks and/or machines with a small number of cores, the
               default sequential checkout often performs better. The size and
               compression level of a repository might also influence how well
               the parallel version performs.

       [1mcheckout.thresholdForParallelism[0m
           When running parallel checkout with a small number of files, the
           cost of subprocess spawning and inter-process communication might
           outweigh the parallelization gains. This setting allows you to
           define the minimum number of files for which parallel checkout
           should be attempted. The default is 100.

       clean.requireForce
           A boolean to make git-clean refuse to delete files unless -f is
           given. Defaults to true.

       [1mclone.defaultRemoteName[0m
           The name of the remote to create when cloning a repository. Defaults
           to [1morigin[22m. It can be overridden by passing the [1m--origin [22mcommand-line
           option to [1mgit-clone[22m(1).

       [1mclone.rejectShallow[0m
           Reject cloning a repository if it is a shallow one; this can be
           overridden by passing the [1m--reject-shallow [22moption on the command
           line. See [1mgit-clone[22m(1).

       [1mclone.filterSubmodules[0m
           If a partial clone filter is provided (see [1m--filter [22min [1mgit-rev-[0m
           [1mlist[22m(1)) and [1m--recurse-submodules [22mis used, also apply the filter to
           submodules.

       color.advice
           A boolean to enable/disable color in hints (e.g. when a push failed,
           see [1madvice.*  [22mfor a list). May be set to [1malways[22m, [1mfalse [22m(or [1mnever[22m) or
           [1mauto [22m(or [1mtrue[22m), in which case colors are used only when the error
           output goes to a terminal. If unset, then the value of [1mcolor.ui [22mis
           used ([1mauto [22mby default).

       color.advice.hint
           Use customized color for hints.

       color.blame.highlightRecent
           Specify the line annotation color for [1mgit blame --color-by-age[0m
           depending upon the age of the line.

           This setting should be set to a comma-separated list of color and
           date settings, starting and ending with a color, the dates should be
           set from oldest to newest. The metadata will be colored with the
           specified colors if the line was introduced before the given
           timestamp, overwriting older timestamped colors.

           Instead of an absolute timestamp relative timestamps work as well,
           e.g.  [1m2.weeks.ago [22mis valid to address anything older than 2 weeks.

           It defaults to [1mblue[22m,12 [1mmonth ago[22m,white,1 [1mmonth ago[22m,red, which colors
           everything older than one year blue, recent changes between one
           month and one year old are kept white, and lines introduced within
           the last month are colored red.

       color.blame.repeatedLines
           Use the specified color to colorize line annotations for [1mgit blame[0m
           [1m--color-lines[22m, if they come from the same commit as the preceding
           line. Defaults to cyan.

       color.branch
           A boolean to enable/disable color in the output of [1mgit-branch[22m(1).
           May be set to [1malways[22m, [1mfalse [22m(or [1mnever[22m) or [1mauto [22m(or [1mtrue[22m), in which
           case colors are used only when the output is to a terminal. If
           unset, then the value of [1mcolor.ui [22mis used ([1mauto [22mby default).

       color.branch.<slot>
           Use customized color for branch coloration.  [4m<slot>[24m is one of
           [1mcurrent [22m(the current branch), [1mlocal [22m(a local branch), [1mremote [22m(a
           remote-tracking branch in refs/remotes/), [1mupstream [22m(upstream
           tracking branch), [1mplain [22m(other refs).

       color.diff
           Whether to use ANSI escape sequences to add color to patches. If
           this is set to [1malways[22m, [1mgit-diff[22m(1), [1mgit-log[22m(1), and [1mgit-show[22m(1) will
           use color for all patches. If it is set to [1mtrue [22mor [1mauto[22m, those
           commands will only use color when output is to the terminal. If
           unset, then the value of [1mcolor.ui [22mis used ([1mauto [22mby default).

           This does not affect [1mgit-format-patch[22m(1) or the [4mgit-diff-*[24m plumbing
           commands. Can be overridden on the command line with the
           [1m--color[22m[[1m=[4m[22m<when>[24m] option.

       color.diff.<slot>

           when branch and tracking information is displayed in the status
           short-format), or [1munmerged [22m(files which have unmerged changes).

       color.transport
           A boolean to enable/disable color when pushes are rejected. May be
           set to [1malways[22m, [1mfalse [22m(or [1mnever[22m) or [1mauto [22m(or [1mtrue[22m), in which case
           colors are used only when the error output goes to a terminal. If
           unset, then the value of [1mcolor.ui [22mis used ([1mauto [22mby default).

       color.transport.rejected
           Use customized color when a push was rejected.

       color.ui
           This variable determines the default value for variables such as
           [1mcolor.diff [22mand [1mcolor.grep [22mthat control the use of color per command
           family. Its scope will expand as more commands learn configuration
           to set a default for the [1m--color [22moption. Set it to [1mfalse [22mor [1mnever [22mif
           you prefer Git commands not to use color unless enabled explicitly
           with some other configuration or the [1m--color [22moption. Set it to
           [1malways [22mif you want all output not intended for machine consumption
           to use color, to [1mtrue [22mor [1mauto [22m(this is the default since Git 1.8.4)
           if you want such output to use color when written to the terminal.

       column.ui
           Specify whether supported commands should output in columns. This
           variable consists of a list of tokens separated by spaces or commas:

           These options control when the feature should be enabled (defaults
           to [4mnever[24m):

           [1malways[0m
               always show in columns

           [1mnever[0m
               never show in columns

           [1mauto[0m
               show in columns if the output is to the terminal

           These options control layout (defaults to [4mcolumn[24m). Setting any of
           these implies [4malways[24m if none of [4malways[24m, [4mnever[24m, or [4mauto[24m are
           specified.

           [1mcolumn[0m
               fill columns before rows

           [1mrow[0m
               fill rows before columns

           [1mplain[0m
               show in one column

           Finally, these options can be combined with a layout option
           (defaults to [4mnodense[24m):

           [1mdense[0m
               make unequal size columns to utilize more space

           [1mnodense[0m
               make equal size columns

       column.branch
           Specify whether to output branch listing in [1mgit branch [22min columns.
           See [1mcolumn.ui [22mfor details.

       column.clean
           Specify the layout when listing items in [1mgit clean -i[22m, which always
           shows files and directories in columns. See [1mcolumn.ui [22mfor details.

       column.status
           Specify whether to output untracked files in [1mgit status [22min columns.
           See [1mcolumn.ui [22mfor details.

       column.tag
           Specify whether to output tag listings in [1mgit tag [22min columns. See
           [1mcolumn.ui [22mfor details.

       [1mcommit.cleanup[0m
           This setting overrides the default of the [1m--cleanup [22moption in [1mgit[0m
           [1mcommit[22m. See [1mgit-commit[22m(1) for details. Changing the default can be
           useful when you always want to keep lines that begin with the
           comment character ([1mcore.commentChar[22m, default #) in your log message,
           in which case you would do [1mgit config commit.cleanup whitespace[0m
           (note that you will have to remove the help lines that begin with
           the comment character in the commit log template yourself, if you do
           this).

       [1mcommit.gpgSign[0m
           A boolean to specify whether all commits should be GPG signed. Use
           of this option when doing operations such as rebase can result in a
           large number of commits being signed. It may be convenient to use an
           agent to avoid typing your GPG passphrase several times.

       [1mcommit.status[0m
           A boolean to enable/disable inclusion of status information in the
           commit message template when using an editor to prepare the commit
           message. Defaults to [1mtrue[22m.

       [1mcommit.template[0m
           Specify the pathname of a file to use as the template for new commit
           messages.

       [1mcommit.verbose[0m
           A boolean or int to specify the level of verbosity with [1mgit commit[22m.
           See [1mgit-commit[22m(1) for details.

       commitGraph.generationVersion
           Specifies the type of generation number version to use when writing
           or reading the commit-graph file. If version 1 is specified, then
           the corrected commit dates will not be written or read. Defaults to
           2.

       commitGraph.maxNewFilters
           Specifies the default value for the [1m--max-new-filters [22moption of [1mgit[0m
           [1mcommit-graph write [22m(c.f., [1mgit-commit-graph[22m(1)).

       commitGraph.readChangedPaths
           Deprecated. Equivalent to commitGraph.changedPathsVersion=-1 if
           true, and commitGraph.changedPathsVersion=0 if false. (If
           commitGraph.changedPathVersion is also set,
           commitGraph.changedPathsVersion takes precedence.)

       commitGraph.changedPathsVersion
           Specifies the version of the changed-path Bloom filters that Git
           will read and write. May be -1, 0, 1, or 2. Note that values greater
           than 1 may be incompatible with older versions of Git which do not
           yet understand those versions. Use caution when operating in a
           mixed-version environment.

           Defaults to -1.

           If -1, Git will use the version of the changed-path Bloom filters in
           the repository, defaulting to 1 if there are none.

           If 0, Git will not read any Bloom filters, and will write version 1
           Bloom filters when instructed to write.

           If 1, Git will only read version 1 Bloom filters, and will write
           version 1 Bloom filters.

           If 2, Git will only read version 2 Bloom filters, and will write
           version 2 Bloom filters.

           See [1mgit-commit-graph[22m(1) for more information.

       completion.commands
           This is only used by git-completion.bash to add or remove commands
           from the list of completed commands. Normally only porcelain
           commands and a few select others are completed. You can add more
           commands, separated by space, in this variable. Prefixing the
           command with [4m-[24m will remove it from the existing list.

       core.fileMode
           Tells Git if the executable bit of files in the working tree is to
           be honored.

           Some filesystems lose the executable bit when a file that is marked
           as executable is checked out, or checks out a non-executable file
           with executable bit on.  [1mgit-clone[22m(1) or [1mgit-init[22m(1) probe the
           filesystem to see if it handles the executable bit correctly and
           this variable is automatically set as necessary.

           A repository, however, may be on a filesystem that handles the
           filemode correctly, and this variable is set to [4mtrue[24m when created,
           but later may be made accessible from another environment that loses
           the filemode (e.g. exporting ext4 via CIFS mount, visiting a Cygwin
           created repository with Git for Windows or Eclipse). In such a case
           it may be necessary to set this variable to [4mfalse[24m. See [1mgit-update-[0m
           [1mindex[22m(1).

           The default is true (when core.filemode is not specified in the
           config file).

       core.hideDotFiles
           (Windows-only) If true, mark newly-created directories and files
           whose name starts with a dot as hidden. If [4mdotGitOnly[24m, only the
           [1m.git/ [22mdirectory is hidden, but no other files starting with a dot.
           The default mode is [4mdotGitOnly[24m.

       core.ignoreCase
           Internal variable which enables various workarounds to enable Git to
           work better on filesystems that are not case sensitive, like APFS,
           HFS+, FAT, NTFS, etc. For example, if a directory listing finds
           "makefile" when Git expects "Makefile", Git will assume it is really
           the same file, and continue to remember it as "Makefile".

           The default is false, except [1mgit-clone[22m(1) or [1mgit-init[22m(1) will probe
           and set core.ignoreCase true if appropriate when the repository is
           created.

           Git relies on the proper configuration of this variable for your
           operating and file system. Modifying this value may result in
           unexpected behavior.

       core.precomposeUnicode
           This option is only used by Mac OS implementation of Git. When
           core.precomposeUnicode=true, Git reverts the unicode decomposition
           of filenames done by Mac OS. This is useful when sharing a
           repository between Mac OS and Linux or Windows. (Git for Windows
           1.7.10 or higher is needed, or Git under cygwin 1.7). When false,
           file names are handled fully transparent by Git, which is backward
           compatible with older versions of Git.

       core.protectHFS
           If set to true, do not allow checkout of paths that would be
           considered equivalent to [1m.git [22mon an HFS+ filesystem. Defaults to
           [1mtrue [22mon Mac OS, and [1mfalse [22melsewhere.

       core.protectNTFS
           If set to true, do not allow checkout of paths that would cause
           problems with the NTFS filesystem, e.g. conflict with 8.3 "short"
           names. Defaults to [1mtrue [22mon Windows, and [1mfalse [22melsewhere.

       core.fsmonitor
           If set to true, enable the built-in file system monitor daemon for
           this working directory ([1mgit-fsmonitor--daemon[22m(1)).

           Like hook-based file system monitors, the built-in file system
           monitor can speed up Git commands that need to refresh the Git index
           (e.g.  [1mgit status[22m) in a working directory with many files. The
           built-in monitor eliminates the need to install and maintain an
           external third-party tool.

           The built-in file system monitor is currently available only on a
           limited set of supported platforms. Currently, this includes Windows
           and MacOS.

               Otherwise, this variable contains the pathname of the "fsmonitor"
               hook command.

           This hook command is used to identify all files that may have
           changed since the requested date/time. This information is used to
           speed up git by avoiding unnecessary scanning of files that have not
           changed.

           See the "fsmonitor-watchman" section of [1mgithooks[22m(5).

           Note that if you concurrently use multiple versions of Git, such as
           one version on the command line and another version in an IDE tool,
           that the definition of [1mcore.fsmonitor [22mwas extended to allow boolean
           values in addition to hook pathnames. Git versions 2.35.1 and prior
           will not understand the boolean values and will consider the "true"
           or "false" values as hook pathnames to be invoked. Git versions 2.26
           thru 2.35.1 default to hook protocol V2 and will fall back to no
           fsmonitor (full scan). Git versions prior to 2.26 default to hook
           protocol V1 and will silently assume there were no changes to report
           (no scan), so status commands may report incomplete results. For
           this reason, it is best to upgrade all of your Git versions before
           using the built-in file system monitor.

       core.fsmonitorHookVersion
           Sets the protocol version to be used when invoking the "fsmonitor"
           hook.

           There are currently versions 1 and 2. When this is not set, version
           2 will be tried first and if it fails then version 1 will be tried.
           Version 1 uses a timestamp as input to determine which files have
           changes since that time but some monitors like Watchman have race
           conditions when used with a timestamp. Version 2 uses an opaque
           string so that the monitor can return something that can be used to
           determine what files have changed without race conditions.

       core.trustctime
           If false, the ctime differences between the index and the working
           tree are ignored; useful when the inode change time is regularly
           modified by something outside Git (file system crawlers and some
           backup systems). See [1mgit-update-index[22m(1). True by default.

       core.splitIndex
           If true, the split-index feature of the index will be used. See [1mgit-[0m
           [1mupdate-index[22m(1). False by default.

       core.untrackedCache
           Determines what to do about the untracked cache feature of the
           index. It will be kept, if this variable is unset or set to [1mkeep[22m. It
           will automatically be added if set to [1mtrue[22m. And it will
           automatically be removed, if set to [1mfalse[22m. Before setting it to
           [1mtrue[22m, you should check that mtime is working properly on your
           system. See [1mgit-update-index[22m(1).  [1mkeep [22mby default, unless
           [1mfeature.manyFiles [22mis enabled which sets this setting to [1mtrue [22mby
           default.

       core.checkStat
           When missing or is set to [1mdefault[22m, many fields in the stat structure
           are checked to detect if a file has been modified since Git looked
           at it. When this configuration variable is set to [1mminimal[22m,
           sub-second part of mtime and ctime, the uid and gid of the owner of
           the file, the inode number (and the device number, if Git was
           compiled to use it), are excluded from the check among these fields,
           leaving only the whole-second part of mtime (and ctime, if
           [1mcore.trustCtime [22mis set) and the filesize to be checked.

           There are implementations of Git that do not leave usable values in
           some fields (e.g. JGit); by excluding these fields from the
           comparison, the [1mminimal [22mmode may help interoperability when the same
           repository is used by these other systems at the same time.

       core.quotePath
           Commands that output paths (e.g.  [4mls-files[24m, [4mdiff[24m), will quote
           "unusual" characters in the pathname by enclosing the pathname in
           double-quotes and escaping those characters with backslashes in the
           same way C escapes control characters (e.g.  [1m\t [22mfor TAB, [1m\n [22mfor LF,
           [1m\\ [22mfor backslash) or bytes with values larger than 0x80 (e.g. octal
           [1m\302\265 [22mfor "micro" in UTF-8). If this variable is set to false,
           bytes higher than 0x80 are not considered "unusual" any more.
           Double-quotes, backslash and control characters are always escaped
           regardless of the setting of this variable. A simple space character
           is not considered "unusual". Many commands can output pathnames
           completely verbatim using the [1m-z [22moption. The default value is true.

       core.eol
           Sets the line ending type to use in the working directory for files
           that are marked as text (either by having the [1mtext [22mattribute set, or
           by having [1mtext=auto [22mand Git auto-detecting the contents as text).
           Alternatives are [4mlf[24m, [4mcrlf[24m and [4mnative[24m, which uses the platform’s
           native line ending. The default value is [1mnative[22m. See
           [1mgitattributes[22m(5) for more information on end-of-line conversion.
           Note that this value is ignored if [1mcore.autocrlf [22mis set to [1mtrue [22mor
           [1minput[22m.

       core.safecrlf
           If true, makes Git check if converting [1mCRLF [22mis reversible when
           end-of-line conversion is active. Git will verify if a command
           modifies a file in the work tree either directly or indirectly. For
           example, committing a file followed by checking out the same file
           should yield the original file in the work tree. If this is not the
           case for the current setting of [1mcore.autocrlf[22m, Git will reject the
           file. The variable can be set to "warn", in which case Git will only
           warn about an irreversible conversion but continue the operation.

           CRLF conversion bears a slight chance of corrupting data. When it is
           enabled, Git will convert CRLF to LF during commit and LF to CRLF
           during checkout. A file that contains a mixture of LF and CRLF
           before the commit cannot be recreated by Git. For text files this is
           the right thing to do: it corrects line endings such that we have
           only LF line endings in the repository. But for binary files that
           are accidentally classified as text the conversion can corrupt data.

           If you recognize such corruption early you can easily fix it by
           setting the conversion type explicitly in .gitattributes. Right
           after committing you still have the original file in your work tree
           and this file is not yet corrupted. You can explicitly tell Git that
           this file is binary and Git will handle the file appropriately.

           Unfortunately, the desired effect of cleaning up text files with
           mixed line endings and the undesired effect of corrupting binary
           files cannot be distinguished. In both cases CRLFs are removed in an
           irreversible way. For text files this is the right thing to do
           because CRLFs are line endings, while for binary files converting
           CRLFs corrupts data.

           Note, this safety check does not mean that a checkout will generate
           a file identical to the original file for a different setting of
           [1mcore.eol [22mand [1mcore.autocrlf[22m, but only for the current one. For
           example, a text file with [1mLF [22mwould be accepted with [1mcore.eol=lf [22mand
           could later be checked out with [1mcore.eol=crlf[22m, in which case the
           resulting file would contain [1mCRLF[22m, although the original file
           contained [1mLF[22m. However, in both work trees the line endings would be
           consistent, that is either all [1mLF [22mor all [1mCRLF[22m, but never mixed. A
           file with mixed line endings would be reported by the [1mcore.safecrlf[0m
           mechanism.

       core.autocrlf
           Setting this variable to "true" is the same as setting the [1mtext[0m
           attribute to "auto" on all files and core.eol to "crlf". Set to true
           if you want to have [1mCRLF [22mline endings in your working directory and
           the repository has LF line endings. This variable can be set to
           [4minput[24m, in which case no output conversion is performed.

       core.checkRoundtripEncoding
           A comma and/or whitespace separated list of encodings that Git
           performs UTF-8 round trip checks on if they are used in an
           [1mworking-tree-encoding [22mattribute (see [1mgitattributes[22m(5)). The default
           value is [1mSHIFT-JIS[22m.

       core.symlinks
           If false, symbolic links are checked out as small plain files that
           contain the link text.  [1mgit-update-index[22m(1) and [1mgit-add[22m(1) will not
           change the recorded type to regular file. Useful on filesystems like
           FAT that do not support symbolic links.

           The default is true, except [1mgit-clone[22m(1) or [1mgit-init[22m(1) will probe
           and set core.symlinks false if appropriate when the repository is
           created.

       core.gitProxy
           A "proxy command" to execute (as [4mcommand[24m [4mhost[24m [4mport[24m) instead of
           establishing direct connection to the remote server when using the
           Git protocol for fetching. If the variable value is in the "COMMAND
           for DOMAIN" format, the command is applied only on hostnames ending
           with the specified domain string. This variable may be set multiple
           times and is matched in the given order; the first match wins.

           Can be overridden by the [1mGIT_PROXY_COMMAND [22menvironment variable
           (which always applies universally, without the special "for"
           handling).

           The special string [1mnone [22mcan be used as the proxy command to specify
           that no proxy be used for a given domain pattern. This is useful for
           excluding servers inside a firewall from proxy use, while defaulting
           to a common proxy for external domains.

       core.sshCommand
           If this variable is set, [1mgit fetch [22mand [1mgit push [22mwill use the
           specified command instead of [1mssh [22mwhen they need to connect to a
           remote system. The command is in the same form as the
           [1mGIT_SSH_COMMAND [22menvironment variable and is overridden when the
           environment variable is set.

       core.ignoreStat
           If true, Git will avoid using lstat() calls to detect if files have
           changed by setting the "assume-unchanged" bit for those tracked
           files which it has updated identically in both the index and working
           tree.

           When files are modified outside of Git, the user will need to stage
           the modified files explicitly (e.g. see [4mExamples[24m section in [1mgit-[0m
           [1mupdate-index[22m(1)). Git will not normally detect changes to those
           files.

           This is useful on systems where lstat() calls are very slow, such as
           CIFS/Microsoft Windows.

           False by default.

       core.preferSymlinkRefs
           Instead of the default "symref" format for HEAD and other symbolic
           reference files, use symbolic links. This is sometimes needed to
           work with old scripts that expect HEAD to be a symbolic link.

       core.alternateRefsCommand
           When advertising tips of available history from an alternate, use
           the shell to execute the specified command instead of [1mgit-for-each-[0m
           [1mref[22m(1). The first argument is the absolute path of the alternate.
           Output must contain one hex object id per line (i.e., the same as
           produced by [1mgit for-each-ref --format=[22m'%([1mobjectname[22m)').

           Note that you cannot generally put [1mgit for-each-ref [22mdirectly into
           the config value, as it does not take a repository path as an
           argument (but you can wrap the command above in a shell script).

       core.alternateRefsPrefixes
           When listing references from an alternate, list only references that
           begin with the given prefix. Prefixes match as if they were given as
           arguments to [1mgit-for-each-ref[22m(1). To list multiple prefixes,
           separate them with whitespace. If [1mcore.alternateRefsCommand [22mis set,
           setting [1mcore.alternateRefsPrefixes [22mhas no effect.

       core.bare
           If true this repository is assumed to be [4mbare[24m and has no working
           directory associated with it. If this is the case a number of
           commands that require a working directory will be disabled, such as
           [1mgit-add[22m(1) or [1mgit-merge[22m(1).

           This setting is automatically guessed by [1mgit-clone[22m(1) or [1mgit-init[22m(1)
           when the repository was created. By default a repository that ends
           in "/.git" is assumed to be not bare (bare = false), while all other
           repositories are assumed to be bare (bare = true).

       core.worktree
           Set the path to the root of the working tree. If [1mGIT_COMMON_DIR[0m
           environment variable is set, core.worktree is ignored and not used
           for determining the root of working tree. This can be overridden by
           the [1mGIT_WORK_TREE [22menvironment variable and the [1m--work-tree[0m
           command-line option. The value can be an absolute path or relative
           to the path to the .git directory, which is either specified by
           --git-dir or GIT_DIR, or automatically discovered. If --git-dir or
           GIT_DIR is specified but none of --work-tree, GIT_WORK_TREE and
           core.worktree is specified, the current working directory is
           regarded as the top level of your working tree.

           Note that this variable is honored even when set in a configuration
           file in a ".git" subdirectory of a directory and its value differs
           from the latter directory (e.g. "/path/to/.git/config" has
           core.worktree set to "/different/path"), which is most likely a
           misconfiguration. Running Git commands in the "/path/to" directory
           will still use "/different/path" as the root of the work tree and
           can cause confusion unless you know what you are doing (e.g. you are
           creating a read-only snapshot of the same index to a location
           different from the repository’s usual working tree).

       core.logAllRefUpdates
           Enable the reflog. Updates to a ref <ref> is logged to the file
           "[1m$GIT_DIR/logs/[4m[22m<ref>[24m", by appending the new and old SHA-1, the
           date/time and the reason of the update, but only when the file
           exists. If this configuration variable is set to [1mtrue[22m, missing
           "[1m$GIT_DIR/logs/[4m[22m<ref>[24m" file is automatically created for branch heads
           (i.e. under [1mrefs/heads/[22m), remote refs (i.e. under [1mrefs/remotes/[22m),
           note refs (i.e. under [1mrefs/notes/[22m), and the symbolic ref [1mHEAD[22m. If it
           is set to [1malways[22m, then a missing reflog is automatically created for
           any ref under [1mrefs/[22m.

           This information can be used to determine what commit was the tip of
           a branch "2 days ago".

           This value is true by default in a repository that has a working
           directory associated with it, and false by default in a bare
           repository.

       core.repositoryFormatVersion
           Internal variable identifying the repository format and layout
           version. See [1mgitrepository-layout[22m(5).

       core.sharedRepository
           When [4mgroup[24m (or [4mtrue[24m), the repository is made shareable between
           several users in a group (making sure all the files and objects are
           group-writable). When [4mall[24m (or [4mworld[24m or [4meverybody[24m), the repository
           will be readable by all users, additionally to being
           group-shareable. When [4mumask[24m (or [4mfalse[24m), Git will use permissions
           reported by umask(2). When [4m0xxx[24m, where [4m0xxx[24m is an octal number,
           files in the repository will have this mode value.  [4m0xxx[24m will
           override user’s umask value (whereas the other options will only
           override requested parts of the user’s umask value). Examples: [4m0660[0m
           will make the repo read/write-able for the owner and group, but
           inaccessible to others (equivalent to [4mgroup[24m unless umask is e.g.
           [4m0022[24m).  [4m0640[24m is a repository that is group-readable but not
           group-writable. See [1mgit-init[22m(1). False by default.

       core.warnAmbiguousRefs
           If true, Git will warn you if the ref name you passed it is
           ambiguous and might match multiple refs in the repository. True by
           default.

       core.compression
           An integer -1..9, indicating a default compression level. -1 is the
           zlib default. 0 means no compression, and 1..9 are various
           speed/size tradeoffs, 9 being slowest. If set, this provides a
           default to other compression variables, such as
           [1mcore.looseCompression [22mand [1mpack.compression[22m.

       core.looseCompression
           An integer -1..9, indicating the compression level for objects that
           are not in a pack file. -1 is the zlib default. 0 means no
           compression, and 1..9 are various speed/size tradeoffs, 9 being
           slowest. If not set, defaults to core.compression. If that is not
           set, defaults to 1 (best speed).

       core.packedGitWindowSize
           Number of bytes of a pack file to map into memory in a single
           mapping operation. Larger window sizes may allow your system to
           process a smaller number of large pack files more quickly. Smaller
           window sizes will negatively affect performance due to increased
           calls to the operating system’s memory manager, but may improve
           performance when accessing a large number of large pack files.

           Default is 1 MiB if NO_MMAP was set at compile time, otherwise 32
           MiB on 32 bit platforms and 1 GiB on 64 bit platforms. This should
           be reasonable for all users/operating systems. You probably do not
           need to adjust this value.

           Common unit suffixes of [4mk[24m, [4mm[24m, or [4mg[24m are supported.

       core.packedGitLimit
           Maximum number of bytes to map simultaneously into memory from pack
           files. If Git needs to access more than this many bytes at once to
           complete an operation it will unmap existing regions to reclaim
           virtual address space within the process.

           Default is 256 MiB on 32 bit platforms and 32 TiB (effectively
           unlimited) on 64 bit platforms. This should be reasonable for all
           users/operating systems, except on the largest projects. You
           probably do not need to adjust this value.

           Common unit suffixes of [4mk[24m, [4mm[24m, or [4mg[24m are supported.

       core.deltaBaseCacheLimit
           Maximum number of bytes per thread to reserve for caching base
           objects that may be referenced by multiple deltified objects. By
           storing the entire decompressed base objects in a cache Git is able
           to avoid unpacking and decompressing frequently used base objects
           multiple times.

           Default is 96 MiB on all platforms. This should be reasonable for
           all users/operating systems, except on the largest projects. You
           probably do not need to adjust this value.

           Common unit suffixes of [4mk[24m, [4mm[24m, or [4mg[24m are supported.

       core.bigFileThreshold
           The size of files considered "big", which as discussed below changes
           the behavior of numerous git commands, as well as how such files are
           stored within the repository. The default is 512 MiB. Common unit
           suffixes of [4mk[24m, [4mm[24m, or [4mg[24m are supported.

           Files above the configured limit will be:

           •   Stored deflated in packfiles, without attempting delta
               compression.

               The default limit is primarily set with this use-case in mind.
               With it, most projects will have their source code and other
               text files delta compressed, but not larger binary media files.

               Storing large files without delta compression avoids excessive
               memory usage, at the slight expense of increased disk usage.

           •   Will be treated as if they were labeled "binary" (see
               [1mgitattributes[22m(5)). e.g.  [1mgit-log[22m(1) and [1mgit-diff[22m(1) will not
               compute diffs for files above this limit.

           •   Will generally be streamed when written, which avoids excessive
               memory usage, at the cost of some fixed overhead. Commands that
               make use of this include [1mgit-archive[22m(1), [1mgit-fast-import[22m(1),
               [1mgit-index-pack[22m(1), [1mgit-unpack-objects[22m(1) and [1mgit-fsck[22m(1).

       core.excludesFile
           Specifies the pathname to the file that contains patterns to
           describe paths that are not meant to be tracked, in addition to
           [1m.gitignore [22m(per-directory) and [1m.git/info/exclude[22m. Defaults to
           [1m$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/ignore[22m. If [1m$XDG_CONFIG_HOME [22mis either not set
           or empty, [1m$HOME/.config/git/ignore [22mis used instead. See
           [1mgitignore[22m(5).

       core.askPass
           Some commands (e.g. svn and http interfaces) that interactively ask
           for a password can be told to use an external program given via the
           value of this variable. Can be overridden by the [1mGIT_ASKPASS[0m
           environment variable. If not set, fall back to the value of the
           [1mSSH_ASKPASS [22menvironment variable or, failing that, a simple password
           prompt. The external program shall be given a suitable prompt as
           command-line argument and write the password on its STDOUT.

       core.attributesFile
           In addition to [1m.gitattributes [22m(per-directory) and
           [1m.git/info/attributes[22m, Git looks into this file for attributes (see
           [1mgitattributes[22m(5)). Path expansions are made the same way as for
           [1mcore.excludesFile[22m. Its default value is
           [1m$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/attributes[22m. If [1m$XDG_CONFIG_HOME [22mis either not
           set or empty, [1m$HOME/.config/git/attributes [22mis used instead.

       core.hooksPath
           By default Git will look for your hooks in the [1m$GIT_DIR/hooks[0m
           directory. Set this to different path, e.g.  [1m/etc/git/hooks[22m, and Git
           will try to find your hooks in that directory, e.g.
           [1m/etc/git/hooks/pre-receive [22minstead of in [1m$GIT_DIR/hooks/pre-receive[22m.

           The path can be either absolute or relative. A relative path is
           taken as relative to the directory where the hooks are run (see the
           "DESCRIPTION" section of [1mgithooks[22m(5)).

           This configuration variable is useful in cases where you’d like to
           centrally configure your Git hooks instead of configuring them on a
           per-repository basis, or as a more flexible and centralized
           alternative to having an [1minit.templateDir [22mwhere you’ve changed
           default hooks.

           You can also disable all hooks entirely by setting [1mcore.hooksPath [22mto
           [1m/dev/null[22m. This is usually only advisable for expert users and on a
           per-command basis using configuration parameters of the form [1mgit -c[0m
           [1mcore.hooksPath=/dev/null [22m....

       core.editor
           Commands such as [1mcommit [22mand [1mtag [22mthat let you edit messages by
           launching an editor use the value of this variable when it is set,
           and the environment variable [1mGIT_EDITOR [22mis not set. See [1mgit-var[22m(1).

       core.commentChar, core.commentString
           Commands such as [1mcommit [22mand [1mtag [22mthat let you edit messages consider
           a line that begins with this character commented, and removes them
           after the editor returns (default [4m#[24m).

           If set to "auto", [1mgit-commit [22mwould select a character that is not
           the beginning character of any line in existing commit messages.

           Note that these two variables are aliases of each other, and in
           modern versions of Git you are free to use a string (e.g., [1m// [22mor
           ⁑⁕⁑) with [1mcommentChar[22m. Versions of Git prior to v2.45.0 will ignore
           [1mcommentString [22mbut will reject a value of [1mcommentChar [22mthat consists
           of more than a single ASCII byte. If you plan to use your config
           with older and newer versions of Git, you may want to specify both:

               [core]
               # single character for older versions
               commentChar = "#"
               # string for newer versions (which will override commentChar
               # because it comes later in the file)
               commentString = "//"

       core.filesRefLockTimeout
           The length of time, in milliseconds, to retry when trying to lock an
           individual reference. Value 0 means not to retry at all; -1 means to
           try indefinitely. Default is 100 (i.e., retry for 100ms).

       core.packedRefsTimeout
           The length of time, in milliseconds, to retry when trying to lock
           the [1mpacked-refs [22mfile. Value 0 means not to retry at all; -1 means to
           try indefinitely. Default is 1000 (i.e., retry for 1 second).

       core.pager
           Text viewer for use by Git commands (e.g., [4mless[24m). The value is meant
           to be interpreted by the shell. The order of preference is the
           [1m$GIT_PAGER [22menvironment variable, then [1mcore.pager [22mconfiguration, then
           [1m$PAGER[22m, and then the default chosen at compile time (usually [4mless[24m).

           When the [1mLESS [22menvironment variable is unset, Git sets it to [1mFRX [22m(if
           [1mLESS [22menvironment variable is set, Git does not change it at all). If
           you want to selectively override Git’s default setting for [1mLESS[22m, you
           can set [1mcore.pager [22mto e.g.  [1mless -S[22m. This will be passed to the
           shell by Git, which will translate the final command to [1mLESS=FRX[0m
           [1mless -S[22m. The environment does not set the [1mS [22moption but the command
           line does, instructing less to truncate long lines. Similarly,
           setting [1mcore.pager [22mto [1mless -+F [22mwill deactivate the [1mF [22moption
           specified by the environment from the command-line, deactivating the
           "quit if one screen" behavior of [1mless[22m. One can specifically activate
           some flags for particular commands: for example, setting [1mpager.blame[0m
           to [1mless -S [22menables line truncation only for [1mgit blame[22m.

           Likewise, when the [1mLV [22menvironment variable is unset, Git sets it to
           [1m-c[22m. You can override this setting by exporting [1mLV [22mwith another value
           or setting [1mcore.pager [22mto [1mlv +c[22m.

       core.whitespace
           A comma separated list of common whitespace problems to notice.  [4mgit[0m
           [4mdiff[24m will use [1mcolor.diff.whitespace [22mto highlight them, and [4mgit[24m [4mapply[0m
           [4m--whitespace=error[24m will consider them as errors. You can prefix [1m- [22mto
           disable any of them (e.g.  [1m-trailing-space[22m):

           •   [1mblank-at-eol [22mtreats trailing whitespaces at the end of the line
               as an error (enabled by default).

           •   [1mspace-before-tab [22mtreats a space character that appears
               immediately before a tab character in the initial indent part of
               the line as an error (enabled by default).

           •   [1mindent-with-non-tab [22mtreats a line that is indented with space
               characters instead of the equivalent tabs as an error (not
               enabled by default).

           •   [1mtab-in-indent [22mtreats a tab character in the initial indent part
               of the line as an error (not enabled by default).

           •   [1mblank-at-eof [22mtreats blank lines added at the end of file as an
               error (enabled by default).

           •   [1mtrailing-space [22mis a short-hand to cover both [1mblank-at-eol [22mand
               [1mblank-at-eof[22m.

           •   [1mcr-at-eol [22mtreats a carriage-return at the end of line as part of
               the line terminator, i.e. with it, [1mtrailing-space [22mdoes not
               trigger if the character before such a carriage-return is not a
               whitespace (not enabled by default).

           •   [1mtabwidth=[4m[22m<n>[24m tells how many character positions a tab occupies;
               this is relevant for [1mindent-with-non-tab [22mand when Git fixes
               [1mtab-in-indent [22merrors. The default tab width is 8. Allowed values
               are 1 to 63.

       core.fsync
           A comma-separated list of components of the repository that should
           be hardened via the core.fsyncMethod when created or modified. You
           can disable hardening of any component by prefixing it with a [4m-[24m.
           Items that are not hardened may be lost in the event of an unclean
           system shutdown. Unless you have special requirements, it is
           recommended that you leave this option empty or pick one of
           [1mcommitted[22m, [1madded[22m, or [1mall[22m.

           When this configuration is encountered, the set of components starts
           with the platform default value, disabled components are removed,
           and additional components are added.  [1mnone [22mresets the state so that
           the platform default is ignored.

           The empty string resets the fsync configuration to the platform
           default. The default on most platforms is equivalent to
           [1mcore.fsync=committed[22m,-loose-object, which has good performance, but
           risks losing recent work in the event of an unclean system shutdown.

           •   [1mnone [22mclears the set of fsynced components.

           •   [1mloose-object [22mhardens objects added to the repo in loose-object
               form.

           •   [1mpack [22mhardens objects added to the repo in packfile form.

           •   [1mpack-metadata [22mhardens packfile bitmaps and indexes.

           •   [1mcommit-graph [22mhardens the commit-graph file.

           •   [1mindex [22mhardens the index when it is modified.

           •   [1mobjects [22mis an aggregate option that is equivalent to
               [1mloose-object[22m,pack.

           •   [1mreference [22mhardens references modified in the repo.

           •   [1mderived-metadata [22mis an aggregate option that is equivalent to
               [1mpack-metadata[22m,commit-graph.

           •   [1mcommitted [22mis an aggregate option that is currently equivalent to
               [1mobjects[22m. This mode sacrifices some performance to ensure that
               work that is committed to the repository with [1mgit commit [22mor
               similar commands is hardened.

           •   [1madded [22mis an aggregate option that is currently equivalent to
               [1mcommitted[22m,index. This mode sacrifices additional performance to
               ensure that the results of commands like [1mgit add [22mand similar
               operations are hardened.

           •   [1mall [22mis an aggregate option that syncs all individual components
               above.

       core.fsyncMethod
           A value indicating the strategy Git will use to harden repository
           data using fsync and related primitives.

           •   [1mfsync [22muses the fsync() system call or platform equivalents.

           •   [1mwriteout-only [22missues pagecache writeback requests, but depending
               on the filesystem and storage hardware, data added to the
               repository may not be durable in the event of a system crash.
               This is the default mode on macOS.

           •   [1mbatch [22menables a mode that uses writeout-only flushes to stage
               multiple updates in the disk writeback cache and then does a
               single full fsync of a dummy file to trigger the disk cache
               flush at the end of the operation.

               Currently [1mbatch [22mmode only applies to loose-object files. Other
               repository data is made durable as if [1mfsync [22mwas specified. This
               mode is expected to be as safe as [1mfsync [22mon macOS for repos
               stored on HFS+ or APFS filesystems and on Windows for repos
               stored on NTFS or ReFS filesystems.

       core.fsyncObjectFiles
           This boolean will enable [4mfsync()[24m when writing object files. This
           setting is deprecated. Use core.fsync instead.

           This setting affects data added to the Git repository in
           loose-object form. When set to true, Git will issue an fsync or
           similar system call to flush caches so that loose-objects remain
           consistent in the face of a unclean system shutdown.

       core.preloadIndex
           Enable parallel index preload for operations like [4mgit[24m [4mdiff[0m

           This can speed up operations like [4mgit[24m [4mdiff[24m and [4mgit[24m [4mstatus[24m especially
           on filesystems like NFS that have weak caching semantics and thus
           relatively high IO latencies. When enabled, Git will do the index
           comparison to the filesystem data in parallel, allowing overlapping
           IO’s. Defaults to true.

       core.unsetenvvars
           Windows-only: comma-separated list of environment variables' names
           that need to be unset before spawning any other process. Defaults to
           [1mPERL5LIB [22mto account for the fact that Git for Windows insists on
           using its own Perl interpreter.

       core.createObject
           You can set this to [4mlink[24m, in which case a hardlink followed by a
           delete of the source are used to make sure that object creation will
           not overwrite existing objects.

           On some file system/operating system combinations, this is
           unreliable. Set this config setting to [4mrename[24m there; however, this
           will remove the check that makes sure that existing object files
           will not get overwritten.

       core.notesRef
           When showing commit messages, also show notes which are stored in
           the given ref. The ref must be fully qualified. If the given ref
           does not exist, it is not an error but means that no notes should be
           printed.

           This setting defaults to "refs/notes/commits", and it can be
           overridden by the [1mGIT_NOTES_REF [22menvironment variable. See [1mgit-[0m
           [1mnotes[22m(1).

       core.commitGraph
           If true, then git will read the commit-graph file (if it exists) to
           parse the graph structure of commits. Defaults to true. See [1mgit-[0m
           [1mcommit-graph[22m(1) for more information.

       core.useReplaceRefs
           If set to [1mfalse[22m, behave as if the [1m--no-replace-objects [22moption was
           given on the command line. See [1mgit[22m(1) and [1mgit-replace[22m(1) for more
           information.

       core.multiPackIndex
           Use the multi-pack-index file to track multiple packfiles using a
           single index. See [1mgit-multi-pack-index[22m(1) for more information.
           Defaults to true.

       core.sparseCheckout
           Enable "sparse checkout" feature. See [1mgit-sparse-checkout[22m(1) for
           more information.

       core.sparseCheckoutCone
           Enables the "cone mode" of the sparse checkout feature. When the
           sparse-checkout file contains a limited set of patterns, this mode
           provides significant performance advantages. The "non-cone mode" can
           be requested to allow specifying more flexible patterns by setting
           this variable to [4mfalse[24m. See [1mgit-sparse-checkout[22m(1) for more
           information.

       core.abbrev
           Set the length object names are abbreviated to. If unspecified or
           set to "auto", an appropriate value is computed based on the
           approximate number of packed objects in your repository, which
           hopefully is enough for abbreviated object names to stay unique for
           some time. If set to "no", no abbreviation is made and the object
           names are shown in their full length. The minimum length is 4.

       core.maxTreeDepth
           The maximum depth Git is willing to recurse while traversing a tree
           (e.g., "a/b/cde/f" has a depth of 4). This is a fail-safe to allow
           Git to abort cleanly, and should not generally need to be adjusted.
           When Git is compiled with MSVC, the default is 512. Otherwise, the
           default is 2048.

       credential.helper
           Specify an external helper to be called when a username or password
           credential is needed; the helper may consult external storage to
           avoid prompting the user for the credentials. This is normally the
           name of a credential helper with possible arguments, but may also be
           an absolute path with arguments or, if preceded by !, shell
           commands.

           Note that multiple helpers may be defined. See [1mgitcredentials[22m(7) for
           details and examples.

       credential.interactive
           By default, Git and any configured credential helpers will ask for
           user input when new credentials are required. Many of these helpers
           will succeed based on stored credentials if those credentials are
           still valid. To avoid the possibility of user interactivity from
           Git, set [1mcredential.interactive=false[22m. Some credential helpers
           respect this option as well.

       credential.useHttpPath
           When acquiring credentials, consider the "path" component of an http
           or https URL to be important. Defaults to false. See
           [1mgitcredentials[22m(7) for more information.

       credential.sanitizePrompt
           By default, user names and hosts that are shown as part of the
           password prompt are not allowed to contain control characters (they
           will be URL-encoded by default). Configure this setting to [1mfalse [22mto
           override that behavior.

       credential.protectProtocol
           By default, Carriage Return characters are not allowed in the
           protocol that is used when Git talks to a credential helper. This
           setting allows users to override this default.

       credential.username
           If no username is set for a network authentication, use this
           username by default. See credential.<context>.* below, and
           [1mgitcredentials[22m(7).

       credential.<url>.*
           Any of the credential.* options above can be applied selectively to
           some credentials. For example,
           "credential.https://example.com.username" would set the default
           username only for https connections to example.com. See
           [1mgitcredentials[22m(7) for details on how URLs are matched.

       credentialCache.ignoreSIGHUP
           Tell git-credential-cache—daemon to ignore SIGHUP, instead of
           quitting.

       credentialStore.lockTimeoutMS
           The length of time, in milliseconds, for git-credential-store to
           retry when trying to lock the credentials file. A value of 0 means
           not to retry at all; -1 means to try indefinitely. Default is 1000
           (i.e., retry for 1s).

       [1mdiff.autoRefreshIndex[0m
           When using [1mgit diff [22mto compare with work tree files, do not consider
           stat-only changes as changed. Instead, silently run [1mgit update-index[0m
           [1m--refresh [22mto update the cached stat information for paths whose
           contents in the work tree match the contents in the index. This
           option defaults to [1mtrue[22m. Note that this affects only [1mgit diff[0m
           Porcelain, and not lower level [1mdiff [22mcommands such as [1mgit diff-files[22m.

       [1mdiff.dirstat[0m
           A comma separated list of [1m--dirstat [22mparameters specifying the
           default behavior of the [1m--dirstat [22moption to [1mgit-diff[22m(1) and friends.
           The defaults can be overridden on the command line (using
           [1m--dirstat=[4m[22m<param>[24m[1m,[22m...). The fallback defaults (when not changed by
           [1mdiff.dirstat[22m) are [1mchanges[22m,noncumulative,3. The following parameters
           are available:

           [1mchanges[0m
               Compute the dirstat numbers by counting the lines that have been
               removed from the source, or added to the destination. This
               ignores the amount of pure code movements within a file. In
               other words, rearranging lines in a file is not counted as much
               as other changes. This is the default behavior when no parameter
               is given.

           [1mlines[0m
               Compute the dirstat numbers by doing the regular line-based diff
               analysis, and summing the removed/added line counts. (For binary
               files, count 64-byte chunks instead, since binary files have no
               natural concept of lines). This is a more expensive [1m--dirstat[0m
               behavior than the [1mchanges [22mbehavior, but it does count rearranged
               lines within a file as much as other changes. The resulting
               output is consistent with what you get from the other [1m--*stat[0m
               options.

           [1mfiles[0m
               Compute the dirstat numbers by counting the number of files
               changed. Each changed file counts equally in the dirstat
               analysis. This is the computationally cheapest [1m--dirstat[0m
               behavior, since it does not have to look at the file contents at
               all.

           [1mcumulative[0m
               Count changes in a child directory for the parent directory as
               well. Note that when using [1mcumulative[22m, the sum of the
               percentages reported may exceed 100%. The default
               (non-cumulative) behavior can be specified with the
               [1mnoncumulative [22mparameter.

           [4m<limit>[0m
               An integer parameter specifies a cut-off percent (3% by
               default). Directories contributing less than this percentage of
               the changes are not shown in the output.

           Example: The following will count changed files, while ignoring
           directories with less than 10% of the total amount of changed files,
           and accumulating child directory counts in the parent directories:
           [1mfiles[22m,10,cumulative.

       [1mdiff.statNameWidth[0m
           Limit the width of the filename part in [1m--stat [22moutput. If set,
           applies to all commands generating [1m--stat [22moutput except
           [1mformat-patch[22m.

       [1mdiff.statGraphWidth[0m
           Limit the width of the graph part in [1m--stat [22moutput. If set, applies
           to all commands generating [1m--stat [22moutput except [1mformat-patch[22m.

       [1mdiff.context[0m
           Generate diffs with [4m<n>[24m lines of context instead of the default of
           3. This value is overridden by the [1m-U [22moption.

       [1mdiff.interHunkContext[0m
           Show the context between diff hunks, up to the specified number of
           lines, thereby fusing the hunks that are close to each other. This
           value serves as the default for the [1m--inter-hunk-context [22mcommand
           line option.

       [1mdiff.external[0m
           If this config variable is set, diff generation is not performed
           using the internal diff machinery, but using the given command. Can
           be overridden with the [1mGIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF [22menvironment variable. The
           command is called with parameters as described under "git Diffs" in
           [1mgit[22m(1). Note: if you want to use an external diff program only on a
           subset of your files, you might want to use [1mgitattributes[22m(5)
           instead.

       [1mdiff.trustExitCode[0m
           If this boolean value is set to [1mtrue [22mthen the [1mdiff.external [22mcommand
           is expected to return exit code 0 if it considers the input files to
           be equal or 1 if it considers them to be different, like [1mdiff[22m(1). If
           it is set to [1mfalse[22m, which is the default, then the command is
           expected to return exit code [1m0 [22mregardless of equality. Any other
           exit code causes Git to report a fatal error.

       [1mdiff.ignoreSubmodules[0m
           Sets the default value of [1m--ignore-submodules[22m. Note that this
           affects only [1mgit diff [22mPorcelain, and not lower level [1mdiff [22mcommands
           such as [1mgit diff-files[22m.  [1mgit checkout [22mand [1mgit switch [22malso honor this
           setting when reporting uncommitted changes. Setting it to [1mall[0m
           disables the submodule summary normally shown by [1mgit commit [22mand [1mgit[0m
           [1mstatus [22mwhen [1mstatus.submoduleSummary [22mis set unless it is overridden
           by using the [1m--ignore-submodules [22mcommand-line option. The [1mgit[0m
           [1msubmodule [22mcommands are not affected by this setting. By default this
           is set to untracked so that any untracked submodules are ignored.

       [1mdiff.mnemonicPrefix[0m
           If set, [1mgit diff [22muses a prefix pair that is different from the
           standard [1ma/ [22mand [1mb/ [22mdepending on what is being compared. When this
           configuration is in effect, reverse diff output also swaps the order
           of the prefixes:

           [1mgit diff[0m
               compares the (i)ndex and the (w)ork tree;

           [1mgit diff HEAD[0m
               compares a (c)ommit and the (w)ork tree;

           [1mgit diff --cached[0m
               compares a (c)ommit and the (i)ndex;

           [1mgit diff HEAD:[4m[22m<file1>[24m [4m<file2>[0m
               compares an (o)bject and a (w)ork tree entity;

           [1mgit diff --no-index [4m[22m<a>[24m [4m<b>[0m
               compares two non-git things [4m<a>[24m and [4m<b>[24m.

       [1mdiff.noPrefix[0m
           If set, [1mgit diff [22mdoes not show any source or destination prefix.

       [1mdiff.srcPrefix[0m
           If set, [1mgit diff [22muses this source prefix. Defaults to [1ma/[22m.

       [1mdiff.dstPrefix[0m
           If set, [1mgit diff [22muses this destination prefix. Defaults to [1mb/[22m.

       [1mdiff.relative[0m
           If set to [1mtrue[22m, [1mgit diff [22mdoes not show changes outside of the
           directory and show pathnames relative to the current directory.

       [1mdiff.orderFile[0m
           File indicating how to order files within a diff. See the [1m-O [22moption
           to [1mgit-diff[22m(1) for details. If [1mdiff.orderFile [22mis a relative
           pathname, it is treated as relative to the top of the working tree.

       [1mdiff.renameLimit[0m
           The number of files to consider in the exhaustive portion of
           copy/rename detection; equivalent to the [1mgit diff [22moption [1m-l[22m. If not
           set, the default value is currently 1000. This setting has no effect
           if rename detection is turned off.

       [1mdiff.renames[0m
           Whether and how Git detects renames. If set to [1mfalse[22m, rename
           detection is disabled. If set to [1mtrue[22m, basic rename detection is
           enabled. If set to [1mcopies [22mor [1mcopy[22m, Git will detect copies, as well.
           Defaults to [1mtrue[22m. Note that this affects only [1mgit diff [22mPorcelain
           like [1mgit-diff[22m(1) and [1mgit-log[22m(1), and not lower level commands such
           as [1mgit-diff-files[22m(1).

       [1mdiff.suppressBlankEmpty[0m
           A boolean to inhibit the standard behavior of printing a space
           before each empty output line. Defaults to [1mfalse[22m.

       [1mdiff.submodule[0m
           Specify the format in which differences in submodules are shown. The
           [1mshort [22mformat just shows the names of the commits at the beginning
           and end of the range. The [1mlog [22mformat lists the commits in the range
           like [1mgit-submodule[22m(1) [1msummary [22mdoes. The [1mdiff [22mformat shows an inline
           diff of the changed contents of the submodule. Defaults to [1mshort[22m.

       [1mdiff.wordRegex[0m
           A POSIX Extended Regular Expression used to determine what is a
           "word" when performing word-by-word difference calculations.
           Character sequences that match the regular expression are "words",
           all other characters are [1mignorable [22mwhitespace.

       [1mdiff.[4m[22m<driver>[24m[1m.command[0m
           The custom diff driver command. See [1mgitattributes[22m(5) for details.

       [1mdiff.[4m[22m<driver>[24m[1m.trustExitCode[0m
           If this boolean value is set to [1mtrue [22mthen the [1mdiff.[4m[22m<driver>[24m[1m.command[0m
           command is expected to return exit code 0 if it considers the input
           files to be equal or 1 if it considers them to be different, like
           [1mdiff[22m(1). If it is set to [1mfalse[22m, which is the default, then the
           command is expected to return exit code 0 regardless of equality.
           Any other exit code causes Git to report a fatal error.

       [1mdiff.[4m[22m<driver>[24m[1m.xfuncname[0m
           The regular expression that the diff driver should use to recognize
           the hunk header. A built-in pattern may also be used. See
           [1mgitattributes[22m(5) for details.

       [1mdiff.[4m[22m<driver>[24m[1m.binary[0m
           Set this option to [1mtrue [22mto make the diff driver treat files as
           binary. See [1mgitattributes[22m(5) for details.

       [1mdiff.[4m[22m<driver>[24m[1m.textconv[0m
           The command that the diff driver should call to generate the
           text-converted version of a file. The result of the conversion is
           used to generate a human-readable diff. See [1mgitattributes[22m(5) for
           details.

       [1mdiff.[4m[22m<driver>[24m[1m.wordRegex[0m
           The regular expression that the diff driver should use to split
           words in a line. See [1mgitattributes[22m(5) for details.

       [1mdiff.[4m[22m<driver>[24m[1m.cachetextconv[0m
           Set this option to [1mtrue [22mto make the diff driver cache the text
           conversion outputs. See [1mgitattributes[22m(5) for details.

       [1mdiff.indentHeuristic[0m
           Set this option to [1mfalse [22mto disable the default heuristics that
           shift diff hunk boundaries to make patches easier to read.

       [1mdiff.algorithm[0m
           Choose a diff algorithm. The variants are as follows:

           [1mdefault[22m, [1mmyers[0m
               The basic greedy diff algorithm. Currently, this is the default.

           [1mminimal[0m
               Spend extra time to make sure the smallest possible diff is
               produced.

           [1mpatience[0m
               Use "patience diff" algorithm when generating patches.

           [1mhistogram[0m
               This algorithm extends the patience algorithm to "support
               low-occurrence common elements".

       [1mdiff.wsErrorHighlight[0m
           Highlight whitespace errors in the [1mcontext[22m, [1mold [22mor [1mnew [22mlines of the
           diff. Multiple values are separated by comma, [1mnone [22mresets previous
           values, [1mdefault [22mreset the list to [1mnew [22mand [1mall [22mis a shorthand for
           [1mold[22m,new,context. The whitespace errors are colored with
           [1mcolor.diff.whitespace[22m. The command line option
           [1m--ws-error-highlight=[4m[22m<kind>[24m overrides this setting.

       [1mdiff.colorMoved[0m
           If set to either a valid [4m<mode>[24m or a [1mtrue [22mvalue, moved lines in a
           diff are colored differently. For details of valid modes see
           [1m--color-moved [22min [1mgit-diff[22m(1). If simply set to [1mtrue [22mthe default
           color mode will be used. When set to [1mfalse[22m, moved lines are not
           colored.

       [1mdiff.colorMovedWS[0m
           When moved lines are colored using e.g. the [1mdiff.colorMoved [22msetting,
           this option controls the mode how spaces are treated. For details of
           valid modes see [1m--color-moved-ws [22min [1mgit-diff[22m(1).

       diff.tool
           Controls which diff tool is used by [1mgit-difftool[22m(1). This variable
           overrides the value configured in [1mmerge.tool[22m. The list below shows
           the valid built-in values. Any other value is treated as a custom
           diff tool and requires that a corresponding difftool.<tool>.cmd
           variable is defined.

       diff.guitool
           Controls which diff tool is used by [1mgit-difftool[22m(1) when the
           -g/--gui flag is specified. This variable overrides the value
           configured in [1mmerge.guitool[22m. The list below shows the valid built-in
           values. Any other value is treated as a custom diff tool and
           requires that a corresponding difftool.<guitool>.cmd variable is
           defined.

       difftool.prompt
           Prompt before each invocation of the diff tool.

       difftool.guiDefault
           Set [1mtrue [22mto use the [1mdiff.guitool [22mby default (equivalent to
           specifying the [1m--gui [22margument), or [1mauto [22mto select [1mdiff.guitool [22mor
           [1mdiff.tool [22mdepending on the presence of a [1mDISPLAY [22menvironment
           variable value. The default is [1mfalse[22m, where the [1m--gui [22margument must
           be provided explicitly for the [1mdiff.guitool [22mto be used.

       extensions.*
           Unless otherwise stated, is an error to specify an extension if
           [1mcore.repositoryFormatVersion [22mis not [1m1[22m. See [1mgitrepository-layout[22m(5).

           compatObjectFormat
               Specify a compatibility hash algorithm to use. The acceptable
               values are [1msha1 [22mand [1msha256[22m. The value specified must be
               different from the value of [1mextensions.objectFormat[22m. This allows
               client level interoperability between git repositories whose
               objectFormat matches this compatObjectFormat. In particular when
               fully implemented the pushes and pulls from a repository in
               whose objectFormat matches compatObjectFormat. As well as being
               able to use oids encoded in compatObjectFormat in addition to
               oids encoded with objectFormat to locally specify objects.

           noop
               This extension does not change git’s behavior at all. It is
               useful only for testing format-1 compatibility.

               For historical reasons, this extension is respected regardless
               of the [1mcore.repositoryFormatVersion [22msetting.

           noop-v1
               This extension does not change git’s behavior at all. It is
               useful only for testing format-1 compatibility.

           objectFormat
               Specify the hash algorithm to use. The acceptable values are
               [1msha1 [22mand [1msha256[22m. If not specified, [1msha1 [22mis assumed.

               Note that this setting should only be set by [1mgit-init[22m(1) or [1mgit-[0m
               [1mclone[22m(1). Trying to change it after initialization will not work
               and will produce hard-to-diagnose issues.

           partialClone
               When enabled, indicates that the repo was created with a partial
               clone (or later performed a partial fetch) and that the remote
               may have omitted sending certain unwanted objects. Such a remote
               is called a "promisor remote" and it promises that all such
               omitted objects can be fetched from it in the future.

               The value of this key is the name of the promisor remote.

               For historical reasons, this extension is respected regardless
               of the [1mcore.repositoryFormatVersion [22msetting.

           preciousObjects
               If enabled, indicates that objects in the repository MUST NOT be
               deleted (e.g., by [1mgit-prune [22mor [1mgit repack -d[22m).

               For historical reasons, this extension is respected regardless
               of the [1mcore.repositoryFormatVersion [22msetting.

           refStorage
               Specify the ref storage format to use. The acceptable values
               are:

               •   [1mfiles [22mfor loose files with packed-refs. This is the default.

               •   [1mreftable [22mfor the reftable format. This format is
                   experimental and its internals are subject to change.

               Note that this setting should only be set by [1mgit-init[22m(1) or [1mgit-[0m
               [1mclone[22m(1). Trying to change it after initialization will not work
               and will produce hard-to-diagnose issues.

           relativeWorktrees
               If enabled, indicates at least one worktree has been linked with
               relative paths. Automatically set if a worktree has been created
               or repaired with either the [1m--relative-paths [22moption or with the
               [1mworktree.useRelativePaths [22mconfig set to [1mtrue[22m.

           worktreeConfig
               If enabled, then worktrees will load config settings from the
               [1m$GIT_DIR/config.worktree [22mfile in addition to the
               [1m$GIT_COMMON_DIR/config [22mfile. Note that [1m$GIT_COMMON_DIR [22mand
               [1m$GIT_DIR [22mare the same for the main working tree, while other
               working trees have [1m$GIT_DIR [22mequal to
               [1m$GIT_COMMON_DIR/worktrees/[4m[22m<id>[24m[1m/[22m. The settings in the
               [1mconfig.worktree [22mfile will override settings from any other
               config files.

               When enabling this extension, you must be careful to move
               certain values from the common config file to the main working
               tree’s [1mconfig.worktree [22mfile, if present:

               •   [1mcore.worktree [22mmust be moved from [1m$GIT_COMMON_DIR/config [22mto
                   [1m$GIT_COMMON_DIR/config.worktree[22m.

               •   If [1mcore.bare [22mis true, then it must be moved from
                   [1m$GIT_COMMON_DIR/config [22mto [1m$GIT_COMMON_DIR/config.worktree[22m.

               It may also be beneficial to adjust the locations of
               [1mcore.sparseCheckout [22mand [1mcore.sparseCheckoutCone [22mdepending on
               your desire for customizable sparse-checkout settings for each
               worktree. By default, the [1mgit sparse-checkout [22mbuiltin enables
               this extension, assigns these config values on a per-worktree
               basis, and uses the [1m$GIT_DIR/info/sparse-checkout [22mfile to
               specify the sparsity for each worktree independently. See [1mgit-[0m
               [1msparse-checkout[22m(1) for more details.

               For historical reasons, this extension is respected regardless
               of the [1mcore.repositoryFormatVersion [22msetting.

       fastimport.unpackLimit
           If the number of objects imported by [1mgit-fast-import[22m(1) is below
           this limit, then the objects will be unpacked into loose object
           files. However, if the number of imported objects equals or exceeds
           this limit, then the pack will be stored as a pack. Storing the pack
           from a fast-import can make the import operation complete faster,
           especially on slow filesystems. If not set, the value of
           [1mtransfer.unpackLimit [22mis used instead.

       feature.*
           The config settings that start with [1mfeature.  [22mmodify the defaults of
           a group of other config settings. These groups are created by the
           Git developer community as recommended defaults and are subject to
           change. In particular, new config options may be added with
           different defaults.

       feature.experimental
           Enable config options that are new to Git, and are being considered
           for future defaults. Config settings included here may be added or
           removed with each release, including minor version updates. These
           settings may have unintended interactions since they are so new.
           Please enable this setting if you are interested in providing
           feedback on experimental features. The new default values are:

           •   [1mfetch.negotiationAlgorithm=skipping [22mmay improve fetch
               negotiation times by skipping more commits at a time, reducing
               the number of round trips.

           •   [1mpack.useBitmapBoundaryTraversal=true [22mmay improve bitmap
               traversal times by walking fewer objects.

           •   [1mpack.allowPackReuse=multi [22mmay improve the time it takes to
               create a pack by reusing objects from multiple packs instead of
               just one.

           •   [1mpack.usePathWalk [22mmay speed up packfile creation and make the
               packfiles be significantly smaller in the presence of certain
               filename collisions with Git’s default name-hash.

           •   [1minit.defaultRefFormat=reftable [22mcauses newly initialized
               repositories to use the reftable format for storing references.
               This new format solves issues with case-insensitive filesystems,
               compresses better and performs significantly better with many
               use cases. Refer to Documentation/technical/reftable.adoc for
               more information on this new storage format.

       feature.manyFiles
           Enable config options that optimize for repos with many files in the
           working directory. With many files, commands such as [1mgit status [22mand
           [1mgit checkout [22mmay be slow and these new defaults improve performance:

           •   [1mindex.skipHash=true [22mspeeds up index writes by not computing a
               trailing checksum. Note that this will cause Git versions
               earlier than 2.13.0 to refuse to parse the index and Git
               versions earlier than 2.40.0 will report a corrupted index
               during [1mgit fsck[22m.

           •   [1mindex.version=4 [22menables path-prefix compression in the index.

           •   [1mcore.untrackedCache=true [22menables the untracked cache. This
               setting assumes that mtime is working on your machine.

       fetch.recurseSubmodules
           This option controls whether [1mgit fetch [22m(and the underlying fetch in
           [1mgit pull[22m) will recursively fetch into populated submodules. This
           option can be set either to a boolean value or to [4mon-demand[24m. Setting
           it to a boolean changes the behavior of fetch and pull to recurse
           unconditionally into submodules when set to true or to not recurse
           at all when set to false. When set to [4mon-demand[24m, fetch and pull will
           only recurse into a populated submodule when its superproject
           retrieves a commit that updates the submodule’s reference. Defaults
           to [4mon-demand[24m, or to the value of [4msubmodule.recurse[24m if set.

       fetch.fsckObjects
           If it is set to true, git-fetch-pack will check all fetched objects.
           See [1mtransfer.fsckObjects [22mfor what’s checked. Defaults to false. If
           not set, the value of [1mtransfer.fsckObjects [22mis used instead.

       fetch.fsck.<msg-id>
           Acts like [1mfsck.[4m[22m<msg-id>[24m, but is used by [1mgit-fetch-pack[22m(1) instead of
           [1mgit-fsck[22m(1). See the [1mfsck.[4m[22m<msg-id>[24m documentation for details.

       fetch.fsck.skipList
           Acts like [1mfsck.skipList[22m, but is used by [1mgit-fetch-pack[22m(1) instead of
           [1mgit-fsck[22m(1). See the [1mfsck.skipList [22mdocumentation for details.

       fetch.unpackLimit
           If the number of objects fetched over the Git native transfer is
           below this limit, then the objects will be unpacked into loose
           object files. However if the number of received objects equals or
           exceeds this limit then the received pack will be stored as a pack,
           after adding any missing delta bases. Storing the pack from a push
           can make the push operation complete faster, especially on slow
           filesystems. If not set, the value of [1mtransfer.unpackLimit [22mis used
           instead.

       fetch.prune
           If true, fetch will automatically behave as if the [1m--prune [22moption
           was given on the command line. See also [1mremote.[4m[22m<name>[24m[1m.prune [22mand the
           PRUNING section of [1mgit-fetch[22m(1).

       fetch.pruneTags
           If true, fetch will automatically behave as if the
           [1mrefs/tags/*:refs/tags/* [22mrefspec was provided when pruning, if not
           set already. This allows for setting both this option and
           [1mfetch.prune [22mto maintain a 1=1 mapping to upstream refs. See also
           [1mremote.[4m[22m<name>[24m[1m.pruneTags [22mand the PRUNING section of [1mgit-fetch[22m(1).

       fetch.all
           If true, fetch will attempt to update all available remotes. This
           behavior can be overridden by passing [1m--no-all [22mor by explicitly
           specifying one or more remote(s) to fetch from. Defaults to false.

       fetch.output
           Control how ref update status is printed. Valid values are [1mfull [22mand
           [1mcompact[22m. Default value is [1mfull[22m. See the OUTPUT section in [1mgit-[0m
           [1mfetch[22m(1) for details.

       fetch.negotiationAlgorithm
           Control how information about the commits in the local repository is
           sent when negotiating the contents of the packfile to be sent by the
           server. Set to "consecutive" to use an algorithm that walks over
           consecutive commits checking each one. Set to "skipping" to use an
           algorithm that skips commits in an effort to converge faster, but
           may result in a larger-than-necessary packfile; or set to "noop" to
           not send any information at all, which will almost certainly result
           in a larger-than-necessary packfile, but will skip the negotiation
           step. Set to "default" to override settings made previously and use
           the default behaviour. The default is normally "consecutive", but if
           [1mfeature.experimental [22mis true, then the default is "skipping".
           Unknown values will cause [4mgit[24m [4mfetch[24m to error out.

           See also the [1m--negotiate-only [22mand [1m--negotiation-tip [22moptions to [1mgit-[0m
           [1mfetch[22m(1).

       fetch.showForcedUpdates
           Set to false to enable [1m--no-show-forced-updates [22min [1mgit-fetch[22m(1) and
           [1mgit-pull[22m(1) commands. Defaults to true.

       fetch.parallel
           Specifies the maximal number of fetch operations to be run in
           parallel at a time (submodules, or remotes when the [1m--multiple[0m
           option of [1mgit-fetch[22m(1) is in effect).

           A value of 0 will give some reasonable default. If unset, it
           defaults to 1.

           For submodules, this setting can be overridden using the
           [1msubmodule.fetchJobs [22mconfig setting.

       fetch.writeCommitGraph
           Set to true to write a commit-graph after every [1mgit fetch [22mcommand
           that downloads a pack-file from a remote. Using the [1m--split [22moption,
           most executions will create a very small commit-graph file on top of
           the existing commit-graph file(s). Occasionally, these files will
           merge and the write may take longer. Having an updated commit-graph
           file helps performance of many Git commands, including [1mgit[0m
           [1mmerge-base[22m, [1mgit push -f[22m, and [1mgit log --graph[22m. Defaults to false.

       fetch.bundleURI
           This value stores a URI for downloading Git object data from a
           bundle URI before performing an incremental fetch from the origin
           Git server. This is similar to how the [1m--bundle-uri [22moption behaves
           in [1mgit-clone[22m(1).  [1mgit clone --bundle-uri [22mwill set the
           [1mfetch.bundleURI [22mvalue if the supplied bundle URI contains a bundle
           list that is organized for incremental fetches.

           If you modify this value and your repository has a
           [1mfetch.bundleCreationToken [22mvalue, then remove that
           [1mfetch.bundleCreationToken [22mvalue before fetching from the new bundle
           URI.

       fetch.bundleCreationToken
           When using [1mfetch.bundleURI [22mto fetch incrementally from a bundle list
           that uses the "creationToken" heuristic, this config value stores
           the maximum [1mcreationToken [22mvalue of the downloaded bundles. This
           value is used to prevent downloading bundles in the future if the
           advertised [1mcreationToken [22mis not strictly larger than this value.

           The creation token values are chosen by the provider serving the
           specific bundle URI. If you modify the URI at [1mfetch.bundleURI[22m, then
           be sure to remove the value for the [1mfetch.bundleCreationToken [22mvalue
           before fetching.

       filter.<driver>.clean
           The command which is used to convert the content of a worktree file
           to a blob upon checkin. See [1mgitattributes[22m(5) for details.

       filter.<driver>.smudge
           The command which is used to convert the content of a blob object to
           a worktree file upon checkout. See [1mgitattributes[22m(5) for details.

       format.attach
           Enable multipart/mixed attachments as the default for [4mformat-patch[24m.
           The value can also be a double quoted string which will enable
           attachments as the default and set the value as the boundary. See
           the --attach option in [1mgit-format-patch[22m(1). To countermand an
           earlier value, set it to an empty string.

       format.from
           Provides the default value for the [1m--from [22moption to format-patch.
           Accepts a boolean value, or a name and email address. If false,
           format-patch defaults to [1m--no-from[22m, using commit authors directly in
           the "From:" field of patch mails. If true, format-patch defaults to
           [1m--from[22m, using your committer identity in the "From:" field of patch
           mails and including a "From:" field in the body of the patch mail if
           different. If set to a non-boolean value, format-patch uses that
           value instead of your committer identity. Defaults to false.

       format.forceInBodyFrom
           Provides the default value for the [1m--[22m[[1mno-[22m][1mforce-in-body-from [22moption
           to format-patch. Defaults to false.

       format.numbered
           A boolean which can enable or disable sequence numbers in patch
           subjects. It defaults to "auto" which enables it only if there is
           more than one patch. It can be enabled or disabled for all messages
           by setting it to "true" or "false". See --numbered option in [1mgit-[0m
           [1mformat-patch[22m(1).

       format.headers
           Additional email headers to include in a patch to be submitted by
           mail. See [1mgit-format-patch[22m(1).

       format.to, format.cc
           Additional recipients to include in a patch to be submitted by mail.
           See the --to and --cc options in [1mgit-format-patch[22m(1).

       format.subjectPrefix
           The default for format-patch is to output files with the [4m[PATCH][0m
           subject prefix. Use this variable to change that prefix.

       format.coverFromDescription
           The default mode for format-patch to determine which parts of the
           cover letter will be populated using the branch’s description. See
           the [1m--cover-from-description [22moption in [1mgit-format-patch[22m(1).

       format.signature
           The default for format-patch is to output a signature containing the
           Git version number. Use this variable to change that default. Set
           this variable to the empty string ("") to suppress signature
           generation.

       format.signatureFile
           Works just like format.signature except the contents of the file
           specified by this variable will be used as the signature.

       format.suffix
           The default for format-patch is to output files with the suffix
           [1m.patch[22m. Use this variable to change that suffix (make sure to
           include the dot if you want it).

       format.encodeEmailHeaders
           Encode email headers that have non-ASCII characters with
           "Q-encoding" (described in RFC 2047) for email transmission.
           Defaults to true.

       format.pretty
           The default pretty format for log/show/whatchanged command. See [1mgit-[0m
           [1mlog[22m(1), [1mgit-show[22m(1), [1mgit-whatchanged[22m(1).

       format.thread
           The default threading style for [4mgit[24m [4mformat-patch[24m. Can be a boolean
           value, or [1mshallow [22mor [1mdeep[22m.  [1mshallow [22mthreading makes every mail a
           reply to the head of the series, where the head is chosen from the
           cover letter, the [1m--in-reply-to[22m, and the first patch mail, in this
           order.  [1mdeep [22mthreading makes every mail a reply to the previous one.
           A true boolean value is the same as [1mshallow[22m, and a false value
           disables threading.

       format.signOff
           A boolean value which lets you enable the [1m-s/--signoff [22moption of
           format-patch by default.  [1mNote: [22mAdding the [1mSigned-off-by [22mtrailer to
           a patch should be a conscious act and means that you certify you
           have the rights to submit this work under the same open source
           license. Please see the [4mSubmittingPatches[24m document for further
           discussion.

       format.coverLetter
           A boolean that controls whether to generate a cover-letter when
           format-patch is invoked, but in addition can be set to "auto", to
           generate a cover-letter only when there’s more than one patch.
           Default is false.

       format.outputDirectory
           Set a custom directory to store the resulting files instead of the
           current working directory. All directory components will be created.

       format.filenameMaxLength
           The maximum length of the output filenames generated by the
           [1mformat-patch [22mcommand; defaults to 64. Can be overridden by the
           [1m--filename-max-length=[4m[22m<n>[24m command line option.

       format.useAutoBase
           A boolean value which lets you enable the [1m--base=auto [22moption of
           format-patch by default. Can also be set to "whenAble" to allow
           enabling [1m--base=auto [22mif a suitable base is available, but to skip
           adding base info otherwise without the format dying.

       format.notes
           Provides the default value for the [1m--notes [22moption to format-patch.
           Accepts a boolean value, or a ref which specifies where to get
           notes. If false, format-patch defaults to [1m--no-notes[22m. If true,
           format-patch defaults to [1m--notes[22m. If set to a non-boolean value,
           format-patch defaults to [1m--notes=[4m[22m<ref>[24m, where [1mref [22mis the non-boolean
           value. Defaults to false.

           If one wishes to use the ref [1mrefs/notes/true[22m, please use that
           literal instead.

           This configuration can be specified multiple times in order to allow
           multiple notes refs to be included. In that case, it will behave
           similarly to multiple [1m--[22m[[1mno-[22m][1mnotes[22m[[1m=[22m] options passed in. That is, a
           value of [1mtrue [22mwill show the default notes, a value of [4m<ref>[24m will
           also show notes from that notes ref and a value of [1mfalse [22mwill negate
           previous configurations and not show notes.

           For example,

               [format]
                       notes = true
                       notes = foo
                       notes = false
                       notes = bar

           will only show notes from [1mrefs/notes/bar[22m.

       format.mboxrd
           A boolean value which enables the robust "mboxrd" format when
           [1m--stdout [22mis in use to escape "^>+From " lines.

       format.noprefix
           If set, do not show any source or destination prefix in patches.
           This is equivalent to the [1mdiff.noprefix [22moption used by [1mgit diff [22m(but
           which is not respected by [1mformat-patch[22m). Note that by setting this,
           the receiver of any patches you generate will have to apply them
           using the [1m-p0 [22moption.

       fsck.<msg-id>
           During fsck git may find issues with legacy data which wouldn’t be
           generated by current versions of git, and which wouldn’t be sent
           over the wire if [1mtransfer.fsckObjects [22mwas set. This feature is
           intended to support working with legacy repositories containing such
           data.

           Setting [1mfsck.[4m[22m<msg-id>[24m will be picked up by [1mgit-fsck[22m(1), but to
           accept pushes of such data set [1mreceive.fsck.[4m[22m<msg-id>[24m instead, or to
           clone or fetch it set [1mfetch.fsck.[4m[22m<msg-id>[24m.

           The rest of the documentation discusses [1mfsck.*  [22mfor brevity, but the
           same applies for the corresponding [1mreceive.fsck.*  [22mand [1mfetch.fsck.*[22m.
           variables.

           Unlike variables like [1mcolor.ui [22mand [1mcore.editor[22m, the
           [1mreceive.fsck.[4m[22m<msg-id>[24m and [1mfetch.fsck.[4m[22m<msg-id>[24m variables will not
           fall back on the [1mfsck.[4m[22m<msg-id>[24m configuration if they aren’t set. To
           uniformly configure the same fsck settings in different
           circumstances, all three of them must be set to the same values.

           When [1mfsck.[4m[22m<msg-id>[24m is set, errors can be switched to warnings and
           vice versa by configuring the [1mfsck.[4m[22m<msg-id>[24m setting where the
           [4m<msg-id>[24m is the fsck message ID and the value is one of [1merror[22m, [1mwarn[0m
           or [1mignore[22m. For convenience, fsck prefixes the error/warning with the
           message ID, e.g. "missingEmail: invalid author/committer line -
           missing email" means that setting [1mfsck.missingEmail = ignore [22mwill
           hide that issue.

           In general, it is better to enumerate existing objects with problems
           with [1mfsck.skipList[22m, instead of listing the kind of breakages these
           problematic objects share to be ignored, as doing the latter will
           allow new instances of the same breakages go unnoticed.

           Setting an unknown [1mfsck.[4m[22m<msg-id>[24m value will cause fsck to die, but
           doing the same for [1mreceive.fsck.[4m[22m<msg-id>[24m and [1mfetch.fsck.[4m[22m<msg-id>[0m
           will only cause git to warn.

           See the [1mFsck Messages [22msection of [1mgit-fsck[22m(1) for supported values of
           [4m<msg-id>[24m.

       fsck.skipList
           The path to a list of object names (i.e. one unabbreviated SHA-1 per
           line) that are known to be broken in a non-fatal way and should be
           ignored. On versions of Git 2.20 and later, comments ([4m#[24m), empty
           lines, and any leading and trailing whitespace are ignored.
           Everything but a SHA-1 per line will error out on older versions.

           This feature is useful when an established project should be
           accepted despite early commits containing errors that can be safely
           ignored, such as invalid committer email addresses. Note: corrupt
           objects cannot be skipped with this setting.

           Like [1mfsck.[4m[22m<msg-id>[24m this variable has corresponding
           [1mreceive.fsck.skipList [22mand [1mfetch.fsck.skipList [22mvariants.

           Unlike variables like [1mcolor.ui [22mand [1mcore.editor [22mthe
           [1mreceive.fsck.skipList [22mand [1mfetch.fsck.skipList [22mvariables will not
           fall back on the [1mfsck.skipList [22mconfiguration if they aren’t set. To
           uniformly configure the same fsck settings in different
           circumstances, all three of them must be set to the same values.

           Older versions of Git (before 2.20) documented that the object names
           list should be sorted. This was never a requirement; the object
           names could appear in any order, but when reading the list we
           tracked whether the list was sorted for the purposes of an internal
           binary search implementation, which could save itself some work with
           an already sorted list. Unless you had a humongous list there was no
           reason to go out of your way to pre-sort the list. After Git version
           2.20 a hash implementation is used instead, so there’s now no reason
           to pre-sort the list.

       fsmonitor.allowRemote
           By default, the fsmonitor daemon refuses to work with
           network-mounted repositories. Setting [1mfsmonitor.allowRemote [22mto [1mtrue[0m
           overrides this behavior. Only respected when [1mcore.fsmonitor [22mis set
           to [1mtrue[22m.

       fsmonitor.socketDir
           This Mac OS-specific option, if set, specifies the directory in
           which to create the Unix domain socket used for communication
           between the fsmonitor daemon and various Git commands. The directory
           must reside on a native Mac OS filesystem. Only respected when
           [1mcore.fsmonitor [22mis set to [1mtrue[22m.

       gc.aggressiveDepth
           The depth parameter used in the delta compression algorithm used by
           [4mgit[24m [4mgc[24m [4m--aggressive[24m. This defaults to 50, which is the default for
           the [1m--depth [22moption when [1m--aggressive [22misn’t in use.

           See the documentation for the [1m--depth [22moption in [1mgit-repack[22m(1) for
           more details.

       gc.aggressiveWindow
           The window size parameter used in the delta compression algorithm
           used by [4mgit[24m [4mgc[24m [4m--aggressive[24m. This defaults to 250, which is a much
           more aggressive window size than the default [1m--window [22mof 10.

           See the documentation for the [1m--window [22moption in [1mgit-repack[22m(1) for
           more details.

       gc.auto
           When there are approximately more than this many loose objects in
           the repository, [1mgit gc --auto [22mwill pack them. Some Porcelain
           commands use this command to perform a light-weight garbage
           collection from time to time. The default value is 6700.

           Setting this to 0 disables not only automatic packing based on the
           number of loose objects, but also any other heuristic [1mgit gc --auto[0m
           will otherwise use to determine if there’s work to do, such as
           [1mgc.autoPackLimit[22m.

       gc.autoPackLimit
           When there are more than this many packs that are not marked with
           [1m*.keep [22mfile in the repository, [1mgit gc --auto [22mconsolidates them into
           one larger pack. The default value is 50. Setting this to 0 disables
           it. Setting [1mgc.auto [22mto 0 will also disable this.

           See the [1mgc.bigPackThreshold [22mconfiguration variable below. When in
           use, it’ll affect how the auto pack limit works.

       gc.autoDetach
           Make [1mgit gc --auto [22mreturn immediately and run in the background if
           the system supports it. Default is true. This config variable acts
           as a fallback in case [1mmaintenance.autoDetach [22mis not set.

       gc.bigPackThreshold
           If non-zero, all non-cruft packs larger than this limit are kept
           when [1mgit gc [22mis run. This is very similar to [1m--keep-largest-pack[0m
           except that all non-cruft packs that meet the threshold are kept,
           not just the largest pack. Defaults to zero. Common unit suffixes of
           [4mk[24m, [4mm[24m, or [4mg[24m are supported.

           Note that if the number of kept packs is more than gc.autoPackLimit,
           this configuration variable is ignored, all packs except the base
           pack will be repacked. After this the number of packs should go
           below gc.autoPackLimit and gc.bigPackThreshold should be respected
           again.

           If the amount of memory estimated for [1mgit repack [22mto run smoothly is
           not available and [1mgc.bigPackThreshold [22mis not set, the largest pack
           will also be excluded (this is the equivalent of running [1mgit gc [22mwith
           [1m--keep-largest-pack[22m).

       gc.writeCommitGraph
           If true, then gc will rewrite the commit-graph file when [1mgit-gc[22m(1)
           is run. When using [1mgit gc --auto [22mthe commit-graph will be updated if
           housekeeping is required. Default is true. See [1mgit-commit-graph[22m(1)
           for details.

       gc.logExpiry
           If the file gc.log exists, then [1mgit gc --auto [22mwill print its content
           and exit with status zero instead of running unless that file is
           more than [4mgc.logExpiry[24m old. Default is "1.day". See [1mgc.pruneExpire[0m
           for more ways to specify its value.

       gc.packRefs
           Running [1mgit pack-refs [22min a repository renders it unclonable by Git
           versions prior to 1.5.1.2 over dumb transports such as HTTP. This
           variable determines whether [4mgit[24m [4mgc[24m runs [1mgit pack-refs[22m. This can be
           set to [1mnotbare [22mto enable it within all non-bare repos or it can be
           set to a boolean value. The default is [1mtrue[22m.

       gc.cruftPacks
           Store unreachable objects in a cruft pack (see [1mgit-repack[22m(1))
           instead of as loose objects. The default is [1mtrue[22m.

       gc.maxCruftSize
           Limit the size of new cruft packs when repacking. When specified in
           addition to [1m--max-cruft-size[22m, the command line option takes
           priority. See the [1m--max-cruft-size [22moption of [1mgit-repack[22m(1).

       gc.pruneExpire
           When [4mgit[24m [4mgc[24m is run, it will call [4mprune[24m [4m--expire[24m [4m2.weeks.ago[24m (and
           [4mrepack[24m [4m--cruft[24m [4m--cruft-expiration[24m [4m2.weeks.ago[24m if using cruft packs
           via [1mgc.cruftPacks [22mor [1m--cruft[22m). Override the grace period with this
           config variable. The value "now" may be used to disable this grace
           period and always prune unreachable objects immediately, or "never"
           may be used to suppress pruning. This feature helps prevent
           corruption when [4mgit[24m [4mgc[24m runs concurrently with another process
           writing to the repository; see the "NOTES" section of [1mgit-gc[22m(1).

       gc.worktreePruneExpire
           When [4mgit[24m [4mgc[24m is run, it calls [4mgit[24m [4mworktree[24m [4mprune[24m [4m--expire[0m
           [4m3.months.ago[24m. This config variable can be used to set a different
           grace period. The value "now" may be used to disable the grace
           period and prune [1m$GIT_DIR/worktrees [22mimmediately, or "never" may be
           used to suppress pruning.

       gc.reflogExpire, gc.<pattern>.reflogExpire
           [4mgit[24m [4mreflog[24m [4mexpire[24m removes reflog entries older than this time;
           defaults to 90 days. The value "now" expires all entries
           immediately, and "never" suppresses expiration altogether. With
           "<pattern>" (e.g. "refs/stash") in the middle the setting applies
           only to the refs that match the <pattern>.

       gc.reflogExpireUnreachable, gc.<pattern>.reflogExpireUnreachable
           [4mgit[24m [4mreflog[24m [4mexpire[24m removes reflog entries older than this time and
           are not reachable from the current tip; defaults to 30 days. The
           value "now" expires all entries immediately, and "never" suppresses
           expiration altogether. With "<pattern>" (e.g. "refs/stash") in the
           middle, the setting applies only to the refs that match the
           <pattern>.

           These types of entries are generally created as a result of using
           [1mgit commit --amend [22mor [1mgit rebase [22mand are the commits prior to the
           amend or rebase occurring. Since these changes are not part of the
           current project most users will want to expire them sooner, which is
           why the default is more aggressive than [1mgc.reflogExpire[22m.

       gc.recentObjectsHook
           When considering whether or not to remove an object (either when
           generating a cruft pack or storing unreachable objects as loose),
           use the shell to execute the specified command(s). Interpret their
           output as object IDs which Git will consider as "recent", regardless
           of their age. By treating their mtimes as "now", any objects (and
           their descendants) mentioned in the output will be kept regardless
           of their true age.

           Output must contain exactly one hex object ID per line, and nothing
           else. Objects which cannot be found in the repository are ignored.
           Multiple hooks are supported, but all must exit successfully, else
           the operation (either generating a cruft pack or unpacking
           unreachable objects) will be halted.

       gc.repackFilter
           When repacking, use the specified filter to move certain objects
           into a separate packfile. See the [1m--filter=[4m[22m<filter-spec>[24m option of
           [1mgit-repack[22m(1).

       gc.repackFilterTo
           When repacking and using a filter, see [1mgc.repackFilter[22m, the
           specified location will be used to create the packfile containing
           the filtered out objects.  [1mWARNING: [22mThe specified location should be
           accessible, using for example the Git alternates mechanism,
           otherwise the repo could be considered corrupt by Git as it might
           not be able to access the objects in that packfile. See the
           [1m--filter-to=[4m[22m<dir>[24m option of [1mgit-repack[22m(1) and the
           [1mobjects/info/alternates [22msection of [1mgitrepository-layout[22m(5).

       gc.rerereResolved
           Records of conflicted merge you resolved earlier are kept for this
           many days when [4mgit[24m [4mrerere[24m [4mgc[24m is run. You can also use more
           human-readable "1.month.ago", etc. The default is 60 days. See [1mgit-[0m
           [1mrerere[22m(1).

       gc.rerereUnresolved
           Records of conflicted merge you have not resolved are kept for this
           many days when [4mgit[24m [4mrerere[24m [4mgc[24m is run. You can also use more
           human-readable "1.month.ago", etc. The default is 15 days. See [1mgit-[0m
           [1mrerere[22m(1).

       gitcvs.commitMsgAnnotation
           Append this string to each commit message. Set to empty string to
           disable this feature. Defaults to "via git-CVS emulator".

       gitcvs.enabled
           Whether the CVS server interface is enabled for this repository. See
           [1mgit-cvsserver[22m(1).

       gitcvs.logFile
           Path to a log file where the CVS server interface well... logs
           various stuff. See [1mgit-cvsserver[22m(1).

       gitcvs.usecrlfattr
           If true, the server will look up the end-of-line conversion
           attributes for files to determine the [1m-k [22mmodes to use. If the
           attributes force Git to treat a file as text, the [1m-k [22mmode will be
           left blank so CVS clients will treat it as text. If they suppress
           text conversion, the file will be set with [4m-kb[24m mode, which
           suppresses any newline munging the client might otherwise do. If the
           attributes do not allow the file type to be determined, then
           [1mgitcvs.allBinary [22mis used. See [1mgitattributes[22m(5).

       gitcvs.allBinary
           This is used if [1mgitcvs.usecrlfattr [22mdoes not resolve the correct [4m-kb[0m
           mode to use. If true, all unresolved files are sent to the client in
           mode [4m-kb[24m. This causes the client to treat them as binary files,
           which suppresses any newline munging it otherwise might do.
           Alternatively, if it is set to "guess", then the contents of the
           file are examined to decide if it is binary, similar to
           [1mcore.autocrlf[22m.

       gitcvs.dbName
           Database used by git-cvsserver to cache revision information derived
           from the Git repository. The exact meaning depends on the used
           database driver, for SQLite (which is the default driver) this is a
           filename. Supports variable substitution (see [1mgit-cvsserver[22m(1) for
           details). May not contain semicolons (;). Default:
           [4m%Ggitcvs.%m.sqlite[0m

       gitcvs.dbDriver
           Used Perl DBI driver. You can specify any available driver for this
           here, but it might not work. git-cvsserver is tested with
           [4mDBD::SQLite[24m, reported to work with [4mDBD::Pg[24m, and reported [1mnot [22mto work
           with [4mDBD::mysql[24m. Experimental feature. May not contain double colons
           ([1m:[22m). Default: [4mSQLite[24m. See [1mgit-cvsserver[22m(1).

       gitcvs.dbUser, gitcvs.dbPass
           Database user and password. Only useful if setting [1mgitcvs.dbDriver[22m,
           since SQLite has no concept of database users and/or passwords.
           [4mgitcvs.dbUser[24m supports variable substitution (see [1mgit-cvsserver[22m(1)
           for details).

       gitcvs.dbTableNamePrefix
           Database table name prefix. Prepended to the names of any database
           tables used, allowing a single database to be used for several
           repositories. Supports variable substitution (see [1mgit-cvsserver[22m(1)
           for details). Any non-alphabetic characters will be replaced with
           underscores.

       All gitcvs variables except for [1mgitcvs.usecrlfattr [22mand [1mgitcvs.allBinary[0m
       can also be specified as [4mgitcvs.<access_method>.<varname>[24m (where
       [4maccess_method[24m is one of "ext" and "pserver") to make them apply only for
       the given access method.

       gpg.program
           Pathname of the program to use instead of "[1mgpg[22m" when making or
           verifying a PGP signature. The program must support the same
           command-line interface as GPG, namely, to verify a detached
           signature, "[1mgpg --verify $signature - [22m<$file" is run, and the
           program is expected to signal a good signature by exiting with code
           0. To generate an ASCII-armored detached signature, the standard
           input of "[1mgpg -bsau $key[22m" is fed with the contents to be signed, and
           the program is expected to send the result to its standard output.

       gpg.format
           Specifies which key format to use when signing with [1m--gpg-sign[22m.
           Default is "openpgp". Other possible values are "x509", "ssh".

           See [1mgitformat-signature[22m(5) for the signature format, which differs
           based on the selected [1mgpg.format[22m.

       gpg.<format>.program
           Use this to customize the program used for the signing format you
           chose. (see [1mgpg.program [22mand [1mgpg.format[22m) [1mgpg.program [22mcan still be
           used as a legacy synonym for [1mgpg.openpgp.program[22m. The default value
           for [1mgpg.x509.program [22mis "gpgsm" and [1mgpg.ssh.program [22mis "ssh-keygen".

       gpg.minTrustLevel
           Specifies a minimum trust level for signature verification. If this
           option is unset, then signature verification for merge operations
           requires a key with at least [1mmarginal [22mtrust. Other operations that
           perform signature verification require a key with at least [1mundefined[0m
           trust. Setting this option overrides the required trust-level for
           all operations. Supported values, in increasing order of
           significance:

           •   [1mundefined[0m

           •   [1mnever[0m

           •   [1mmarginal[0m

           •   [1mfully[0m

           •   [1multimate[0m

       gpg.ssh.defaultKeyCommand
           This command will be run when user.signingkey is not set and a ssh
           signature is requested. On successful exit a valid ssh public key
           prefixed with [1mkey:: [22mis expected in the first line of its output.
           This allows for a script doing a dynamic lookup of the correct
           public key when it is impractical to statically configure
           [1muser.signingKey[22m. For example when keys or SSH Certificates are
           rotated frequently or selection of the right key depends on external
           factors unknown to git.

       gpg.ssh.allowedSignersFile
           A file containing ssh public keys which you are willing to trust.
           The file consists of one or more lines of principals followed by an
           ssh public key. e.g.: [1muser1@example.com[22m,user2@example.com [1mssh-rsa[0m
           [1mAAAAX1.[22m.. See ssh-keygen(1) "ALLOWED SIGNERS" for details. The
           principal is only used to identify the key and is available when
           verifying a signature.

           SSH has no concept of trust levels like gpg does. To be able to
           differentiate between valid signatures and trusted signatures the
           trust level of a signature verification is set to [1mfully [22mwhen the
           public key is present in the allowedSignersFile. Otherwise the trust
           level is [1mundefined [22mand git verify-commit/tag will fail.

           This file can be set to a location outside of the repository and
           every developer maintains their own trust store. A central
           repository server could generate this file automatically from ssh
           keys with push access to verify the code against. In a corporate
           setting this file is probably generated at a global location from
           automation that already handles developer ssh keys.

           A repository that only allows signed commits can store the file in
           the repository itself using a path relative to the top-level of the
           working tree. This way only committers with an already valid key can
           add or change keys in the keyring.

           Since OpensSSH 8.8 this file allows specifying a key lifetime using
           valid-after & valid-before options. Git will mark signatures as
           valid if the signing key was valid at the time of the signature’s
           creation. This allows users to change a signing key without
           invalidating all previously made signatures.

           Using a SSH CA key with the cert-authority option (see ssh-keygen(1)
           "CERTIFICATES") is also valid.

       gpg.ssh.revocationFile
           Either a SSH KRL or a list of revoked public keys (without the
           principal prefix). See ssh-keygen(1) for details. If a public key is
           found in this file then it will always be treated as having trust
           level "never" and signatures will show as invalid.

       grep.lineNumber
           If set to true, enable [1m-n [22moption by default.

       grep.column
           If set to true, enable the [1m--column [22moption by default.

       grep.patternType
           Set the default matching behavior. Using a value of [4mbasic[24m, [4mextended[24m,
           [4mfixed[24m, or [4mperl[24m will enable the [1m--basic-regexp[22m, [1m--extended-regexp[22m,
           [1m--fixed-strings[22m, or [1m--perl-regexp [22moption accordingly, while the
           value [4mdefault[24m will use the [1mgrep.extendedRegexp [22moption to choose
           between [4mbasic[24m and [4mextended[24m.

       grep.extendedRegexp
           If set to true, enable [1m--extended-regexp [22moption by default. This
           option is ignored when the [1mgrep.patternType [22moption is set to a value
           other than [4mdefault[24m.

       grep.threads
           Number of grep worker threads to use. If unset (or set to 0), Git
           will use as many threads as the number of logical cores available.

       grep.fullName
           If set to true, enable [1m--full-name [22moption by default.

       grep.fallbackToNoIndex
           If set to true, fall back to [1mgit grep --no-index [22mif [1mgit grep [22mis
           executed outside of a git repository. Defaults to false.

       gui.commitMsgWidth
           Defines how wide the commit message window is in the [1mgit-gui[22m(1).
           "75" is the default.

       gui.diffContext
           Specifies how many context lines should be used in calls to diff
           made by the [1mgit-gui[22m(1). The default is "5".

       gui.displayUntracked
           Determines if [1mgit-gui[22m(1) shows untracked files in the file list. The
           default is "true".

       gui.encoding
           Specifies the default character encoding to use for displaying of
           file contents in [1mgit-gui[22m(1) and [1mgitk[22m(1). It can be overridden by
           setting the [4mencoding[24m attribute for relevant files (see
           [1mgitattributes[22m(5)). If this option is not set, the tools default to
           the locale encoding.

       gui.matchTrackingBranch
           Determines if new branches created with [1mgit-gui[22m(1) should default to
           tracking remote branches with matching names or not. Default:
           "false".

       gui.newBranchTemplate
           Is used as a suggested name when creating new branches using the
           [1mgit-gui[22m(1).

       gui.pruneDuringFetch
           "true" if [1mgit-gui[22m(1) should prune remote-tracking branches when
           performing a fetch. The default value is "false".

       gui.trustmtime
           Determines if [1mgit-gui[22m(1) should trust the file modification
           timestamp or not. By default the timestamps are not trusted.

       gui.spellingDictionary
           Specifies the dictionary used for spell checking commit messages in
           the [1mgit-gui[22m(1). When set to "none" spell checking is turned off.

       gui.fastCopyBlame
           If true, [4mgit[24m [4mgui[24m [4mblame[24m uses [1m-C [22minstead of [1m-C -C [22mfor original
           location detection. It makes blame significantly faster on huge
           repositories at the expense of less thorough copy detection.

       gui.copyBlameThreshold
           Specifies the threshold to use in [4mgit[24m [4mgui[24m [4mblame[24m original location
           detection, measured in alphanumeric characters. See the [1mgit-blame[22m(1)
           manual for more information on copy detection.

       gui.blamehistoryctx
           Specifies the radius of history context in days to show in [1mgitk[22m(1)
           for the selected commit, when the [1mShow History Context [22mmenu item is
           invoked from [4mgit[24m [4mgui[24m [4mblame[24m. If this variable is set to zero, the
           whole history is shown.

       guitool.<name>.cmd
           Specifies the shell command line to execute when the corresponding
           item of the [1mgit-gui[22m(1) [1mTools [22mmenu is invoked. This option is
           mandatory for every tool. The command is executed from the root of
           the working directory, and in the environment it receives the name
           of the tool as [1mGIT_GUITOOL[22m, the name of the currently selected file
           as [4mFILENAME[24m, and the name of the current branch as [4mCUR_BRANCH[24m (if
           the head is detached, [4mCUR_BRANCH[24m is empty).

       guitool.<name>.needsFile
           Run the tool only if a diff is selected in the GUI. It guarantees
           that [4mFILENAME[24m is not empty.

       guitool.<name>.noConsole
           Run the command silently, without creating a window to display its
           output.

       guitool.<name>.noRescan
           Don’t rescan the working directory for changes after the tool
           finishes execution.

       guitool.<name>.confirm
           Show a confirmation dialog before actually running the tool.

       guitool.<name>.argPrompt
           Request a string argument from the user, and pass it to the tool
           through the [1mARGS [22menvironment variable. Since requesting an argument
           implies confirmation, the [4mconfirm[24m option has no effect if this is
           enabled. If the option is set to [4mtrue[24m, [4myes[24m, or [4m1[24m, the dialog uses a
           built-in generic prompt; otherwise the exact value of the variable
           is used.

       guitool.<name>.revPrompt
           Request a single valid revision from the user, and set the [1mREVISION[0m
           environment variable. In other aspects this option is similar to
           [4margPrompt[24m, and can be used together with it.

       guitool.<name>.revUnmerged
           Show only unmerged branches in the [4mrevPrompt[24m subdialog. This is
           useful for tools similar to merge or rebase, but not for things like
           checkout or reset.

       guitool.<name>.title
           Specifies the title to use for the prompt dialog. The default is the
           tool name.

       guitool.<name>.prompt
           Specifies the general prompt string to display at the top of the
           dialog, before subsections for [4margPrompt[24m and [4mrevPrompt[24m. The default
           value includes the actual command.

       help.browser
           Specify the browser that will be used to display help in the [4mweb[0m
           format. See [1mgit-help[22m(1).

       help.format
           Override the default help format used by [1mgit-help[22m(1). Values [4mman[24m,
           [4minfo[24m, [4mweb[24m and [4mhtml[24m are supported.  [4mman[24m is the default.  [4mweb[24m and [4mhtml[0m
           are the same.

       help.autoCorrect
           If git detects typos and can identify exactly one valid command
           similar to the error, git will try to suggest the correct command or
           even run the suggestion automatically. Possible config values are:

           •   0, "false", "off", "no", "show": show the suggested command
               (default).

           •   1, "true", "on", "yes", "immediate": run the suggested command
               immediately.

           •   positive number > 1: run the suggested command after specified
               deciseconds (0.1 sec).

           •   "never": don’t run or show any suggested command.

           •   "prompt": show the suggestion and prompt for confirmation to run
               the command.

       help.htmlPath
           Specify the path where the HTML documentation resides. File system
           paths and URLs are supported. HTML pages will be prefixed with this
           path when help is displayed in the [4mweb[24m format. This defaults to the
           documentation path of your Git installation.

       http.proxy
           Override the HTTP proxy, normally configured using the [4mhttp_proxy[24m,
           [4mhttps_proxy[24m, and [4mall_proxy[24m environment variables (see [1mcurl[22m([1m1[22m)). In
           addition to the syntax understood by curl, it is possible to specify
           a proxy string with a user name but no password, in which case git
           will attempt to acquire one in the same way it does for other
           credentials. See [1mgitcredentials[22m(7) for more information. The syntax
           thus is [4m[protocol://][user[:password]@]proxyhost[:port][/path][24m. This
           can be overridden on a per-remote basis; see remote.<name>.proxy

           Any proxy, however configured, must be completely transparent and
           must not modify, transform, or buffer the request or response in any
           way. Proxies which are not completely transparent are known to cause
           various forms of breakage with Git.

       http.proxyAuthMethod
           Set the method with which to authenticate against the HTTP proxy.
           This only takes effect if the configured proxy string contains a
           user name part (i.e. is of the form [4muser@host[24m or [4muser@host:port[24m).
           This can be overridden on a per-remote basis; see
           [1mremote.[4m[22m<name>[24m[1m.proxyAuthMethod[22m. Both can be overridden by the
           [1mGIT_HTTP_PROXY_AUTHMETHOD [22menvironment variable. Possible values are:

           •   [1manyauth [22m- Automatically pick a suitable authentication method.
               It is assumed that the proxy answers an unauthenticated request
               with a 407 status code and one or more Proxy-authenticate
               headers with supported authentication methods. This is the
               default.

           •   [1mbasic [22m- HTTP Basic authentication

           •   [1mdigest [22m- HTTP Digest authentication; this prevents the password
               from being transmitted to the proxy in clear text

           •   [1mnegotiate [22m- GSS-Negotiate authentication (compare the
               --negotiate option of [1mcurl[22m([1m1[22m))

           •   [1mntlm [22m- NTLM authentication (compare the --ntlm option of
               [1mcurl[22m([1m1[22m))

       http.proxySSLCert
           The pathname of a file that stores a client certificate to use to
           authenticate with an HTTPS proxy. Can be overridden by the
           [1mGIT_PROXY_SSL_CERT [22menvironment variable.

       http.proxySSLKey
           The pathname of a file that stores a private key to use to
           authenticate with an HTTPS proxy. Can be overridden by the
           [1mGIT_PROXY_SSL_KEY [22menvironment variable.

       http.proxySSLCertPasswordProtected
           Enable Git’s password prompt for the proxy SSL certificate.
           Otherwise OpenSSL will prompt the user, possibly many times, if the
           certificate or private key is encrypted. Can be overridden by the
           [1mGIT_PROXY_SSL_CERT_PASSWORD_PROTECTED [22menvironment variable.

       http.proxySSLCAInfo
           Pathname to the file containing the certificate bundle that should
           be used to verify the proxy with when using an HTTPS proxy. Can be
           overridden by the [1mGIT_PROXY_SSL_CAINFO [22menvironment variable.

       http.emptyAuth
           Attempt authentication without seeking a username or password. This
           can be used to attempt GSS-Negotiate authentication without
           specifying a username in the URL, as libcurl normally requires a
           username for authentication.

       http.proactiveAuth
           Attempt authentication without first making an unauthenticated
           attempt and receiving a 401 response. This can be used to ensure
           that all requests are authenticated. If [1mhttp.emptyAuth [22mis set to
           true, this value has no effect.

           If the credential helper used specifies an authentication scheme
           (i.e., via the [1mauthtype [22mfield), that value will be used; if a
           username and password is provided without a scheme, then Basic
           authentication is used. The value of the option determines the
           scheme requested from the helper. Possible values are:

           •   [1mbasic [22m- Request Basic authentication from the helper.

           •   [1mauto [22m- Allow the helper to pick an appropriate scheme.

           •   [1mnone [22m- Disable proactive authentication.

           Note that TLS should always be used with this configuration, since
           otherwise it is easy to accidentally expose plaintext credentials if
           Basic authentication is selected.

       http.delegation
           Control GSSAPI credential delegation. The delegation is disabled by
           default in libcurl since version 7.21.7. Set parameter to tell the
           server what it is allowed to delegate when it comes to user
           credentials. Used with GSS/kerberos. Possible values are:

           •   [1mnone [22m- Don’t allow any delegation.

           •   [1mpolicy [22m- Delegates if and only if the OK-AS-DELEGATE flag is set
               in the Kerberos service ticket, which is a matter of realm
               policy.

           •   [1malways [22m- Unconditionally allow the server to delegate.

       http.extraHeader
           Pass an additional HTTP header when communicating with a server. If
           more than one such entry exists, all of them are added as extra
           headers. To allow overriding the settings inherited from the system
           config, an empty value will reset the extra headers to the empty
           list.

       http.cookieFile
           The pathname of a file containing previously stored cookie lines,
           which should be used in the Git http session, if they match the
           server. The file format of the file to read cookies from should be
           plain HTTP headers or the Netscape/Mozilla cookie file format (see
           [1mcurl[22m([1m1[22m)). Set it to an empty string, to accept only new cookies from
           the server and send them back in successive requests within same
           connection. NOTE that the file specified with http.cookieFile is
           used only as input unless http.saveCookies is set.

       http.saveCookies
           If set, store cookies received during requests to the file specified
           by http.cookieFile. Has no effect if http.cookieFile is unset, or
           set to an empty string.

       http.version
           Use the specified HTTP protocol version when communicating with a
           server. If you want to force the default. The available and default
           version depend on libcurl. Currently the possible values of this
           option are:

           •   HTTP/2

           •   HTTP/1.1

       http.curloptResolve
           Hostname resolution information that will be used first by libcurl
           when sending HTTP requests. This information should be in one of the
           following formats:

           •   [+]HOST:PORT:ADDRESS[,ADDRESS]

           •   -HOST:PORT

           The first format redirects all requests to the given [1mHOST:PORT [22mto
           the provided [1mADDRESS[22m(s). The second format clears all previous
           config values for that [1mHOST:PORT [22mcombination. To allow easy
           overriding of all the settings inherited from the system config, an
           empty value will reset all resolution information to the empty list.

       http.sslVersion
           The SSL version to use when negotiating an SSL connection, if you
           want to force the default. The available and default version depend
           on whether libcurl was built against NSS or OpenSSL and the
           particular configuration of the crypto library in use. Internally
           this sets the [4mCURLOPT_SSL_VERSION[24m option; see the libcurl
           documentation for more details on the format of this option and for
           the ssl version supported. Currently the possible values of this
           option are:

           •   sslv2

           •   sslv3

           •   tlsv1

           •   tlsv1.0

           •   tlsv1.1

           •   tlsv1.2

           •   tlsv1.3

           Can be overridden by the [1mGIT_SSL_VERSION [22menvironment variable. To
           force git to use libcurl’s default ssl version and ignore any
           explicit http.sslversion option, set [1mGIT_SSL_VERSION [22mto the empty
           string.

       http.sslCipherList
           A list of SSL ciphers to use when negotiating an SSL connection. The
           available ciphers depend on whether libcurl was built against NSS or
           OpenSSL and the particular configuration of the crypto library in
           use. Internally this sets the [4mCURLOPT_SSL_CIPHER_LIST[24m option; see
           the libcurl documentation for more details on the format of this
           list.

           Can be overridden by the [1mGIT_SSL_CIPHER_LIST [22menvironment variable.
           To force git to use libcurl’s default cipher list and ignore any
           explicit http.sslCipherList option, set [1mGIT_SSL_CIPHER_LIST [22mto the
           empty string.

       http.sslVerify
           Whether to verify the SSL certificate when fetching or pushing over
           HTTPS. Defaults to true. Can be overridden by the [1mGIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY[0m
           environment variable.

       http.sslCert
           File containing the SSL certificate when fetching or pushing over
           HTTPS. Can be overridden by the [1mGIT_SSL_CERT [22menvironment variable.

       http.sslKey
           File containing the SSL private key when fetching or pushing over
           HTTPS. Can be overridden by the [1mGIT_SSL_KEY [22menvironment variable.

       http.sslCertPasswordProtected
           Enable Git’s password prompt for the SSL certificate. Otherwise
           OpenSSL will prompt the user, possibly many times, if the
           certificate or private key is encrypted. Can be overridden by the
           [1mGIT_SSL_CERT_PASSWORD_PROTECTED [22menvironment variable.

       http.sslCAInfo
           File containing the certificates to verify the peer with when
           fetching or pushing over HTTPS. Can be overridden by the
           [1mGIT_SSL_CAINFO [22menvironment variable.

       http.sslCAPath
           Path containing files with the CA certificates to verify the peer
           with when fetching or pushing over HTTPS. Can be overridden by the
           [1mGIT_SSL_CAPATH [22menvironment variable.

       http.sslBackend
           Name of the SSL backend to use (e.g. "openssl" or "schannel"). This
           option is ignored if cURL lacks support for choosing the SSL backend
           at runtime.

       http.sslCertType
           Type of client certificate used when fetching or pushing over HTTPS.
           "PEM", "DER" are supported when using openssl or gnutls backends.
           "P12" is supported on "openssl", "schannel", "securetransport", and
           gnutls 8.11+. See also libcurl [1mCURLOPT_SSLCERTTYPE[22m. Can be
           overridden by the [1mGIT_SSL_CERT_TYPE [22menvironment variable.

       http.sslKeyType
           Type of client private key used when fetching or pushing over HTTPS.
           (e.g. "PEM", "DER", or "ENG"). Only applicable when using "openssl"
           backend. "DER" is not supported with openssl. Particularly useful
           when set to "ENG" for authenticating with PKCS#11 tokens, with a
           PKCS#11 URL in sslCert option. See also libcurl [1mCURLOPT_SSLKEYTYPE[22m.
           Can be overridden by the [1mGIT_SSL_KEY_TYPE [22menvironment variable.

       http.schannelCheckRevoke
           Used to enforce or disable certificate revocation checks in cURL
           when http.sslBackend is set to "schannel". Defaults to [1mtrue [22mif
           unset. Only necessary to disable this if Git consistently errors and
           the message is about checking the revocation status of a
           certificate. This option is ignored if cURL lacks support for
           setting the relevant SSL option at runtime.

       http.schannelUseSSLCAInfo
           As of cURL v7.60.0, the Secure Channel backend can use the
           certificate bundle provided via [1mhttp.sslCAInfo[22m, but that would
           override the Windows Certificate Store. Since this is not desirable
           by default, Git will tell cURL not to use that bundle by default
           when the [1mschannel [22mbackend was configured via [1mhttp.sslBackend[22m, unless
           [1mhttp.schannelUseSSLCAInfo [22moverrides this behavior.

       http.pinnedPubkey
           Public key of the https service. It may either be the filename of a
           PEM or DER encoded public key file or a string starting with
           [4msha256//[24m followed by the base64 encoded sha256 hash of the public
           key. See also libcurl [4mCURLOPT_PINNEDPUBLICKEY[24m. git will exit with an
           error if this option is set but not supported by cURL.

       http.sslTry
           Attempt to use AUTH SSL/TLS and encrypted data transfers when
           connecting via regular FTP protocol. This might be needed if the FTP
           server requires it for security reasons or you wish to connect
           securely whenever remote FTP server supports it. Default is false
           since it might trigger certificate verification errors on
           misconfigured servers.

       http.maxRequests
           How many HTTP requests to launch in parallel. Can be overridden by
           the [1mGIT_HTTP_MAX_REQUESTS [22menvironment variable. Default is 5.

       http.minSessions
           The number of curl sessions (counted across slots) to be kept across
           requests. They will not be ended with curl_easy_cleanup() until
           http_cleanup() is invoked. If USE_CURL_MULTI is not defined, this
           value will be capped at 1. Defaults to 1.

       http.postBuffer
           Maximum size in bytes of the buffer used by smart HTTP transports
           when POSTing data to the remote system. For requests larger than
           this buffer size, HTTP/1.1 and Transfer-Encoding: chunked is used to
           avoid creating a massive pack file locally. Default is 1 MiB, which
           is sufficient for most requests.

           Note that raising this limit is only effective for disabling chunked
           transfer encoding and therefore should be used only where the remote
           server or a proxy only supports HTTP/1.0 or is noncompliant with the
           HTTP standard. Raising this is not, in general, an effective
           solution for most push problems, but can increase memory consumption
           significantly since the entire buffer is allocated even for small
           pushes.

       http.lowSpeedLimit, http.lowSpeedTime
           If the HTTP transfer speed, in bytes per second, is less than
           [4mhttp.lowSpeedLimit[24m for longer than [4mhttp.lowSpeedTime[24m seconds, the
           transfer is aborted. Can be overridden by the
           [1mGIT_HTTP_LOW_SPEED_LIMIT [22mand [1mGIT_HTTP_LOW_SPEED_TIME [22menvironment
           variables.

       http.keepAliveIdle
           Specifies how long in seconds to wait on an idle connection before
           sending TCP keepalive probes (if supported by the OS). If unset,
           curl’s default value is used. Can be overridden by the
           [1mGIT_HTTP_KEEPALIVE_IDLE [22menvironment variable.

       http.keepAliveInterval
           Specifies how long in seconds to wait between TCP keepalive probes
           (if supported by the OS). If unset, curl’s default value is used.
           Can be overridden by the [1mGIT_HTTP_KEEPALIVE_INTERVAL [22menvironment
           variable.

       http.keepAliveCount
           Specifies how many TCP keepalive probes to send before giving up and
           terminating the connection (if supported by the OS). If unset,
           curl’s default value is used. Can be overridden by the
           [1mGIT_HTTP_KEEPALIVE_COUNT [22menvironment variable.

       http.noEPSV
           A boolean which disables using of EPSV ftp command by curl. This can
           be helpful with some "poor" ftp servers which don’t support EPSV
           mode. Can be overridden by the [1mGIT_CURL_FTP_NO_EPSV [22menvironment
           variable. Default is false (curl will use EPSV).

       http.userAgent
           The HTTP USER_AGENT string presented to an HTTP server. The default
           value represents the version of the Git client such as git/1.7.1.
           This option allows you to override this value to a more common value
           such as Mozilla/4.0. This may be necessary, for instance, if
           connecting through a firewall that restricts HTTP connections to a
           set of common USER_AGENT strings (but not including those like
           git/1.7.1). Can be overridden by the [1mGIT_HTTP_USER_AGENT [22menvironment
           variable.

       http.followRedirects
           Whether git should follow HTTP redirects. If set to [1mtrue[22m, git will
           transparently follow any redirect issued by a server it encounters.
           If set to [1mfalse[22m, git will treat all redirects as errors. If set to
           [1minitial[22m, git will follow redirects only for the initial request to a
           remote, but not for subsequent follow-up HTTP requests. Since git
           uses the redirected URL as the base for the follow-up requests, this
           is generally sufficient. The default is [1minitial[22m.

       http.<url>.*
           Any of the http.* options above can be applied selectively to some
           URLs. For a config key to match a URL, each element of the config
           key is compared to that of the URL, in the following order:

            1. Scheme (e.g., [1mhttps [22min [1mhttps://example.com/[22m). This field must
               match exactly between the config key and the URL.

            2. Host/domain name (e.g., [1mexample.com [22min [1mhttps://example.com/[22m).
               This field must match between the config key and the URL. It is
               possible to specify a [1m* [22mas part of the host name to match all
               subdomains at this level.  [1mhttps://*.example.com/ [22mfor example
               would match [1mhttps://foo.example.com/[22m, but not
               [1mhttps://foo.bar.example.com/[22m.

            3. Port number (e.g., [1m8080 [22min [1mhttp://example.com:8080/[22m). This field
               must match exactly between the config key and the URL. Omitted
               port numbers are automatically converted to the correct default
               for the scheme before matching.

            4. Path (e.g., [1mrepo.git [22min [1mhttps://example.com/repo.git[22m). The path
               field of the config key must match the path field of the URL
               either exactly or as a prefix of slash-delimited path elements.
               This means a config key with path [1mfoo/ [22mmatches URL path [1mfoo/bar[22m.
               A prefix can only match on a slash ([1m/[22m) boundary. Longer matches
               take precedence (so a config key with path [1mfoo/bar [22mis a better
               match to URL path [1mfoo/bar [22mthan a config key with just path
               [1mfoo/[22m).

            5. User name (e.g., [1muser [22min [1mhttps://user@example.com/repo.git[22m). If
               the config key has a user name it must match the user name in
               the URL exactly. If the config key does not have a user name,
               that config key will match a URL with any user name (including
               none), but at a lower precedence than a config key with a user
               name.

           The list above is ordered by decreasing precedence; a URL that
           matches a config key’s path is preferred to one that matches its
           user name. For example, if the URL is
           [1mhttps://user@example.com/foo/bar [22ma config key match of
           [1mhttps://example.com/foo [22mwill be preferred over a config key match of
           [1mhttps://user@example.com[22m.

           All URLs are normalized before attempting any matching (the password
           part, if embedded in the URL, is always ignored for matching
           purposes) so that equivalent URLs that are simply spelled
           differently will match properly. Environment variable settings
           always override any matches. The URLs that are matched against are
           those given directly to Git commands. This means any URLs visited as
           a result of a redirection do not participate in matching.

       i18n.commitEncoding
           Character encoding the commit messages are stored in; Git itself
           does not care per se, but this information is necessary e.g. when
           importing commits from emails or in the gitk graphical history
           browser (and possibly in other places in the future or in other
           porcelains). See e.g.  [1mgit-mailinfo[22m(1). Defaults to [4mutf-8[24m.

       i18n.logOutputEncoding
           Character encoding the commit messages are converted to when running
           [4mgit[24m [4mlog[24m and friends.

       imap.folder
           The folder to drop the mails into, which is typically the Drafts
           folder. For example: [1mINBOX.Drafts[22m, [1mINBOX/Drafts [22mor [[1mGmail[22m][1m/Drafts[22m.
           The IMAP folder to interact with MUST be specified; the value of
           this configuration variable is used as the fallback default value
           when the [1m--folder [22moption is not given.

       imap.tunnel
           Command used to set up a tunnel to the IMAP server through which
           commands will be piped instead of using a direct network connection
           to the server. Required when imap.host is not set.

       imap.host
           A URL identifying the server. Use an [1mimap:// [22mprefix for non-secure
           connections and an [1mimaps:// [22mprefix for secure connections. Ignored
           when imap.tunnel is set, but required otherwise.

       imap.user
           The username to use when logging in to the server.

       imap.pass
           The password to use when logging in to the server.

       imap.port
           An integer port number to connect to on the server. Defaults to 143
           for imap:// hosts and 993 for imaps:// hosts. Ignored when
           imap.tunnel is set.

       imap.sslverify
           A boolean to enable/disable verification of the server certificate
           used by the SSL/TLS connection. Default is [1mtrue[22m. Ignored when
           imap.tunnel is set.

       imap.preformattedHTML
           A boolean to enable/disable the use of html encoding when sending a
           patch. An html encoded patch will be bracketed with <pre> and have a
           content type of text/html. Ironically, enabling this option causes
           Thunderbird to send the patch as a plain/text, format=fixed email.
           Default is [1mfalse[22m.

       imap.authMethod
           Specify the authentication method for authenticating with the IMAP
           server. If Git was built with the NO_CURL option, or if your curl
           version is older than 7.34.0, or if you’re running git-imap-send
           with the [1m--no-curl [22moption, the only supported methods are [1mPLAIN[22m,
           [1mCRAM-MD5[22m, [1mOAUTHBEARER [22mand [1mXOAUTH2[22m. If this is not set then [1mgit[0m
           [1mimap-send [22muses the basic IMAP plaintext [1mLOGIN [22mcommand.

       include.path, includeIf.<condition>.path
           Special variables to include other configuration files. See the
           "CONFIGURATION FILE" section in the main [1mgit-config[22m(1)
           documentation, specifically the "Includes" and "Conditional
           Includes" subsections.

       index.recordEndOfIndexEntries
           Specifies whether the index file should include an "End Of Index
           Entry" section. This reduces index load time on multiprocessor
           machines but produces a message "ignoring EOIE extension" when
           reading the index using Git versions before 2.20. Defaults to [4mtrue[0m
           if index.threads has been explicitly enabled, [4mfalse[24m otherwise.

       index.recordOffsetTable
           Specifies whether the index file should include an "Index Entry
           Offset Table" section. This reduces index load time on
           multiprocessor machines but produces a message "ignoring IEOT
           extension" when reading the index using Git versions before 2.20.
           Defaults to [4mtrue[24m if index.threads has been explicitly enabled, [4mfalse[0m
           otherwise.

       index.sparse
           When enabled, write the index using sparse-directory entries. This
           has no effect unless [1mcore.sparseCheckout [22mand [1mcore.sparseCheckoutCone[0m
           are both enabled. Defaults to [4mfalse[24m.

       index.threads
           Specifies the number of threads to spawn when loading the index.
           This is meant to reduce index load time on multiprocessor machines.
           Specifying 0 or [4mtrue[24m will cause Git to auto-detect the number of
           CPUs and set the number of threads accordingly. Specifying 1 or
           [4mfalse[24m will disable multithreading. Defaults to [4mtrue[24m.

       index.version
           Specify the version with which new index files should be
           initialized. This does not affect existing repositories. If
           [1mfeature.manyFiles [22mis enabled, then the default is 4.

       index.skipHash
           When enabled, do not compute the trailing hash for the index file.
           This accelerates Git commands that manipulate the index, such as [1mgit[0m
           [1madd[22m, [1mgit commit[22m, or [1mgit status[22m. Instead of storing the checksum,
           write a trailing set of bytes with value zero, indicating that the
           computation was skipped.

           If you enable [1mindex.skipHash[22m, then Git clients older than 2.13.0
           will refuse to parse the index and Git clients older than 2.40.0
           will report an error during [1mgit fsck[22m.

       [1minit.templateDir[0m
           Specify the directory from which templates will be copied. (See the
           "TEMPLATE DIRECTORY" section of [1mgit-init[22m(1).)

       [1minit.defaultBranch[0m
           Allows overriding the default branch name e.g. when initializing a
           new repository.

       [1minit.defaultObjectFormat[0m
           Allows overriding the default object format for new repositories.
           See [1m--object-format= [22min [1mgit-init[22m(1). Both the command line option
           and the [1mGIT_DEFAULT_HASH [22menvironment variable take precedence over
           this config.

       [1minit.defaultRefFormat[0m
           Allows overriding the default ref storage format for new
           repositories. See [1m--ref-format= [22min [1mgit-init[22m(1). Both the command
           line option and the [1mGIT_DEFAULT_REF_FORMAT [22menvironment variable take
           precedence over this config.

       instaweb.browser
           Specify the program that will be used to browse your working
           repository in gitweb. See [1mgit-instaweb[22m(1).

       instaweb.httpd
           The HTTP daemon command-line to start gitweb on your working
           repository. See [1mgit-instaweb[22m(1).

       instaweb.local
           If true the web server started by [1mgit-instaweb[22m(1) will be bound to
           the local IP (127.0.0.1).

       instaweb.modulePath
           The default module path for [1mgit-instaweb[22m(1) to use instead of
           /usr/lib/apache2/modules. Only used if httpd is Apache.

       instaweb.port
           The port number to bind the gitweb httpd to. See [1mgit-instaweb[22m(1).

       interactive.singleKey
           When set to true, allow the user to provide one-letter input with a
           single key (i.e., without hitting the Enter key) in interactive
           commands. This is currently used by the [1m--patch [22mmode of [1mgit-add[22m(1),
           [1mgit-checkout[22m(1), [1mgit-restore[22m(1), [1mgit-commit[22m(1), [1mgit-reset[22m(1), and
           [1mgit-stash[22m(1).

       interactive.diffFilter
           When an interactive command (such as [1mgit add --patch[22m) shows a
           colorized diff, git will pipe the diff through the shell command
           defined by this configuration variable. The command may mark up the
           diff further for human consumption, provided that it retains a
           one-to-one correspondence with the lines in the original diff.
           Defaults to disabled (no filtering).

       [1mlog.abbrevCommit[0m
           If [1mtrue[22m, make [1mgit-log[22m(1), [1mgit-show[22m(1), and [1mgit-whatchanged[22m(1) assume
           [1m--abbrev-commit[22m. You may override this option with
           [1m--no-abbrev-commit[22m.

       [1mlog.date[0m
           Set the default date-time mode for the [1mlog [22mcommand. Setting a value
           for log.date is similar to using [1mgit log[22m's [1m--date [22moption. See [1mgit-[0m
           [1mlog[22m(1) for details.

           If the format is set to "auto:foo" and the pager is in use, format
           "foo" will be used for the date format. Otherwise, "default" will be
           used.

       [1mlog.decorate[0m
           Print out the ref names of any commits that are shown by the log
           command. Possible values are:

               `short`;; the ref name prefixes `refs/heads/`, `refs/tags/` and
                       `refs/remotes/` are not printed.
               `full`;; the full ref name (including prefix) are printed.
               `auto`;; if the output is going to a terminal,
                       the ref names are shown as if `short` were given, otherwise no ref
                       names are shown.

           This is the same as the [1m--decorate [22moption of the [1mgit log[22m.

       [1mlog.initialDecorationSet[0m
           By default, [1mgit log [22monly shows decorations for certain known ref
           namespaces. If [4mall[24m is specified, then show all refs as decorations.

       [1mlog.excludeDecoration[0m
           Exclude the specified patterns from the log decorations. This is
           similar to the [1m--decorate-refs-exclude [22mcommand-line option, but the
           config option can be overridden by the [1m--decorate-refs [22moption.

       [1mlog.diffMerges[0m
           Set diff format to be used when [1m--diff-merges=on [22mis specified, see
           [1m--diff-merges [22min [1mgit-log[22m(1) for details. Defaults to [1mseparate[22m.

       [1mlog.follow[0m
           If [1mtrue[22m, [1mgit log [22mwill act as if the [1m--follow [22moption was used when a
           single <path> is given. This has the same limitations as [1m--follow[22m,
           i.e. it cannot be used to follow multiple files and does not work
           well on non-linear history.

       [1mlog.graphColors[0m
           A list of colors, separated by commas, that can be used to draw
           history lines in [1mgit log --graph[22m.

       [1mlog.showRoot[0m
           If true, the initial commit will be shown as a big creation event.
           This is equivalent to a diff against an empty tree. Tools like [1mgit-[0m
           [1mlog[22m(1) or [1mgit-whatchanged[22m(1), which normally hide the root commit
           will now show it. True by default.

       [1mlog.showSignature[0m
           If true, makes [1mgit-log[22m(1), [1mgit-show[22m(1), and [1mgit-whatchanged[22m(1)
           assume [1m--show-signature[22m.

       [1mlog.mailmap[0m
           If true, makes [1mgit-log[22m(1), [1mgit-show[22m(1), and [1mgit-whatchanged[22m(1)
           assume [1m--use-mailmap[22m, otherwise assume [1m--no-use-mailmap[22m. True by
           default.

       lsrefs.unborn
           May be "advertise" (the default), "allow", or "ignore". If
           "advertise", the server will respond to the client sending "unborn"
           (as described in [1mgitprotocol-v2[22m(5)) and will advertise support for
           this feature during the protocol v2 capability advertisement.
           "allow" is the same as "advertise" except that the server will not
           advertise support for this feature; this is useful for load-balanced
           servers that cannot be updated atomically (for example), since the
           administrator could configure "allow", then after a delay, configure
           "advertise".

       mailinfo.scissors
           If true, makes [1mgit-mailinfo[22m(1) (and therefore [1mgit-am[22m(1)) act by
           default as if the --scissors option was provided on the
           command-line. When active, this feature removes everything from the
           message body before a scissors line (i.e. consisting mainly of ">8",
           "8<" and "-").

       mailmap.file
           The location of an augmenting mailmap file. The default mailmap,
           located in the root of the repository, is loaded first, then the
           mailmap file pointed to by this variable. The location of the
           mailmap file may be in a repository subdirectory, or somewhere
           outside of the repository itself. See [1mgit-shortlog[22m(1) and [1mgit-[0m
           [1mblame[22m(1).

       mailmap.blob
           Like [1mmailmap.file[22m, but consider the value as a reference to a blob
           in the repository. If both [1mmailmap.file [22mand [1mmailmap.blob [22mare given,
           both are parsed, with entries from [1mmailmap.file [22mtaking precedence.
           In a bare repository, this defaults to [1mHEAD:.mailmap[22m. In a non-bare
           repository, it defaults to empty.

       maintenance.auto
           This boolean config option controls whether some commands run [1mgit[0m
           [1mmaintenance run --auto [22mafter doing their normal work. Defaults to
           true.

       maintenance.autoDetach
           Many Git commands trigger automatic maintenance after they have
           written data into the repository. This boolean config option
           controls whether this automatic maintenance shall happen in the
           foreground or whether the maintenance process shall detach and
           continue to run in the background.

           If unset, the value of [1mgc.autoDetach [22mis used as a fallback. Defaults
           to true if both are unset, meaning that the maintenance process will
           detach.

       maintenance.strategy
           This string config option provides a way to specify one of a few
           recommended schedules for background maintenance. This only affects
           which tasks are run during [1mgit maintenance run --schedule=X[0m
           commands, provided no [1m--task=[4m[22m<task>[24m arguments are provided. Further,
           if a [1mmaintenance.[4m[22m<task>[24m[1m.schedule [22mconfig value is set, then that
           value is used instead of the one provided by [1mmaintenance.strategy[22m.
           The possible strategy strings are:

           •   [1mnone[22m: This default setting implies no tasks are run at any
               schedule.

           •   [1mincremental[22m: This setting optimizes for performing small
               maintenance activities that do not delete any data. This does
               not schedule the [1mgc [22mtask, but runs the [1mprefetch [22mand [1mcommit-graph[0m
               tasks hourly, the [1mloose-objects [22mand [1mincremental-repack [22mtasks
               daily, and the [1mpack-refs [22mtask weekly.

       maintenance.<task>.enabled
           This boolean config option controls whether the maintenance task
           with name [4m<task>[24m is run when no [1m--task [22moption is specified to [1mgit[0m
           [1mmaintenance run[22m. These config values are ignored if a [1m--task [22moption
           exists. By default, only [1mmaintenance.gc.enabled [22mis true.

       maintenance.<task>.schedule
           This config option controls whether or not the given [4m<task>[24m runs
           during a [1mgit maintenance run --schedule=[4m[22m<frequency>[24m command. The
           value must be one of "hourly", "daily", or "weekly".

       maintenance.commit-graph.auto
           This integer config option controls how often the [1mcommit-graph [22mtask
           should be run as part of [1mgit maintenance run --auto[22m. If zero, then
           the [1mcommit-graph [22mtask will not run with the [1m--auto [22moption. A
           negative value will force the task to run every time. Otherwise, a
           positive value implies the command should run when the number of
           reachable commits that are not in the commit-graph file is at least
           the value of [1mmaintenance.commit-graph.auto[22m. The default value is
           100.

       maintenance.loose-objects.auto
           This integer config option controls how often the [1mloose-objects [22mtask
           should be run as part of [1mgit maintenance run --auto[22m. If zero, then
           the [1mloose-objects [22mtask will not run with the [1m--auto [22moption. A
           negative value will force the task to run every time. Otherwise, a
           positive value implies the command should run when the number of
           loose objects is at least the value of
           [1mmaintenance.loose-objects.auto[22m. The default value is 100.

       maintenance.loose-objects.batchSize
           This integer config option controls the maximum number of loose
           objects written into a packfile during the [1mloose-objects [22mtask. The
           default is fifty thousand. Use value [1m0 [22mto indicate no limit.

       maintenance.incremental-repack.auto
           This integer config option controls how often the [1mincremental-repack[0m
           task should be run as part of [1mgit maintenance run --auto[22m. If zero,
           then the [1mincremental-repack [22mtask will not run with the [1m--auto[0m
           option. A negative value will force the task to run every time.
           Otherwise, a positive value implies the command should run when the
           number of pack-files not in the multi-pack-index is at least the
           value of [1mmaintenance.incremental-repack.auto[22m. The default value is
           10.

       maintenance.reflog-expire.auto
           This integer config option controls how often the [1mreflog-expire [22mtask
           should be run as part of [1mgit maintenance run --auto[22m. If zero, then
           the [1mreflog-expire [22mtask will not run with the [1m--auto [22moption. A
           negative value will force the task to run every time. Otherwise, a
           positive value implies the command should run when the number of
           expired reflog entries in the "HEAD" reflog is at least the value of
           [1mmaintenance.loose-objects.auto[22m. The default value is 100.

       maintenance.rerere-gc.auto
           This integer config option controls how often the [1mrerere-gc [22mtask
           should be run as part of [1mgit maintenance run --auto[22m. If zero, then
           the [1mrerere-gc [22mtask will not run with the [1m--auto [22moption. A negative
           value will force the task to run every time. Otherwise, any positive
           value implies the command will run when the "rr-cache" directory
           exists and has at least one entry, regardless of whether it is stale
           or not. This heuristic may be refined in the future. The default
           value is 1.

       maintenance.worktree-prune.auto
           This integer config option controls how often the [1mworktree-prune[0m
           task should be run as part of [1mgit maintenance run --auto[22m. If zero,
           then the [1mworktree-prune [22mtask will not run with the [1m--auto [22moption. A
           negative value will force the task to run every time. Otherwise, a
           positive value implies the command should run when the number of
           prunable worktrees exceeds the value. The default value is 1.

       man.viewer
           Specify the programs that may be used to display help in the [4mman[0m
           format. See [1mgit-help[22m(1).

       man.<tool>.cmd
           Specify the command to invoke the specified man viewer. The
           specified command is evaluated in shell with the man page passed as
           an argument. (See [1mgit-help[22m(1).)

       man.<tool>.path
           Override the path for the given tool that may be used to display
           help in the [4mman[24m format. See [1mgit-help[22m(1).

       [1mmerge.conflictStyle[0m
           Specify the style in which conflicted hunks are written out to
           working tree files upon merge. The default is "merge", which shows a
           [1m<<<<<<< [22mconflict marker, changes made by one side, a [1m======= [22mmarker,
           changes made by the other side, and then a [1m>>>>>>> [22mmarker. An
           alternate style, "diff3", adds a [1m||||||| [22mmarker and the original
           text before the [1m======= [22mmarker. The "merge" style tends to produce
           smaller conflict regions than diff3, both because of the exclusion
           of the original text, and because when a subset of lines match on
           the two sides, they are just pulled out of the conflict region.
           Another alternate style, "zdiff3", is similar to diff3 but removes
           matching lines on the two sides from the conflict region when those
           matching lines appear near either the beginning or end of a conflict
           region.

       [1mmerge.defaultToUpstream[0m
           If merge is called without any commit argument, merge the upstream
           branches configured for the current branch by using their last
           observed values stored in their remote-tracking branches. The values
           of the [1mbranch.[22m<current [1mbranch[22m>[1m.merge [22mthat name the branches at the
           remote named by [1mbranch.[4m[22m<current-branch>[24m[1m.remote [22mare consulted, and
           then they are mapped via [1mremote.[4m[22m<remote>[24m[1m.fetch [22mto their
           corresponding remote-tracking branches, and the tips of these
           tracking branches are merged. Defaults to true.

       [1mmerge.ff[0m
           By default, Git does not create an extra merge commit when merging a
           commit that is a descendant of the current commit. Instead, the tip
           of the current branch is fast-forwarded. When set to [1mfalse[22m, this
           variable tells Git to create an extra merge commit in such a case
           (equivalent to giving the [1m--no-ff [22moption from the command line).
           When set to [1monly[22m, only such fast-forward merges are allowed
           (equivalent to giving the [1m--ff-only [22moption from the command line).

       [1mmerge.verifySignatures[0m
           If true, this is equivalent to the [1m--verify-signatures [22mcommand line
           option. See [1mgit-merge[22m(1) for details.

       [1mmerge.branchdesc[0m
           In addition to branch names, populate the log message with the
           branch description text associated with them. Defaults to false.

       [1mmerge.log[0m
           In addition to branch names, populate the log message with at most
           the specified number of one-line descriptions from the actual
           commits that are being merged. Defaults to false, and true is a
           synonym for 20.

       [1mmerge.suppressDest[0m
           By adding a glob that matches the names of integration branches to
           this multi-valued configuration variable, the default merge message
           computed for merges into these integration branches will omit "into
           [4m<branch-name>[24m" from its title.

           An element with an empty value can be used to clear the list of
           globs accumulated from previous configuration entries. When there is
           no [1mmerge.suppressDest [22mvariable defined, the default value of [1mmaster[0m
           is used for backward compatibility.

       [1mmerge.renameLimit[0m
           The number of files to consider in the exhaustive portion of rename
           detection during a merge. If not specified, defaults to the value of
           [1mdiff.renameLimit[22m. If neither [1mmerge.renameLimit [22mnor [1mdiff.renameLimit[0m
           are specified, currently defaults to 7000. This setting has no
           effect if rename detection is turned off.

       [1mmerge.renames[0m
           Whether Git detects renames. If set to [1mfalse[22m, rename detection is
           disabled. If set to [1mtrue[22m, basic rename detection is enabled.
           Defaults to the value of diff.renames.

       [1mmerge.directoryRenames[0m
           Whether Git detects directory renames, affecting what happens at
           merge time to new files added to a directory on one side of history
           when that directory was renamed on the other side of history.
           Possible values are:

           [1mfalse[0m
               Directory rename detection is disabled, meaning that such new
               files will be left behind in the old directory.

           [1mtrue[0m
               Directory rename detection is enabled, meaning that such new
               files will be moved into the new directory.

           [1mconflict[0m
               A conflict will be reported for such paths.

           If [1mmerge.renames [22mis [1mfalse[22m, [1mmerge.directoryRenames [22mis ignored and
           treated as [1mfalse[22m. Defaults to [1mconflict[22m.

       [1mmerge.renormalize[0m
           Tell Git that canonical representation of files in the repository
           has changed over time (e.g. earlier commits record text files with
           [4mCRLF[24m line endings, but recent ones use [4mLF[24m line endings). In such a
           repository, for each file where a three-way content merge is needed,
           Git can convert the data recorded in commits to a canonical form
           before performing a merge to reduce unnecessary conflicts. For more
           information, see section "Merging branches with differing
           checkin/checkout attributes" in [1mgitattributes[22m(5).

       [1mmerge.stat[0m
           What, if anything, to print between [1mORIG_HEAD [22mand the merge result
           at the end of the merge. Possible values are:

           [1mfalse[0m
               Show nothing.

           [1mtrue[0m
               Show [1mgit diff --diffstat --summary ORIG_HEAD[22m.

           [1mcompact[0m
               Show [1mgit diff --compact-summary ORIG_HEAD[22m.

           but any unrecognised value (e.g., a value added by a future version
           of Git) is taken as [1mtrue [22minstead of triggering an error. Defaults to
           [1mtrue[22m.

       [1mmerge.autoStash[0m
           When set to [1mtrue[22m, automatically create a temporary stash entry
           before the operation begins, and apply it after the operation ends.
           This means that you can run merge on a dirty worktree. However, use
           with care: the final stash application after a successful merge
           might result in non-trivial conflicts. This option can be overridden
           by the [1m--no-autostash [22mand [1m--autostash [22moptions of [1mgit-merge[22m(1).
           Defaults to [1mfalse[22m.

       [1mmerge.tool[0m
           Controls which merge tool is used by [1mgit-mergetool[22m(1). The list
           below shows the valid built-in values. Any other value is treated as
           a custom merge tool and requires that a corresponding
           [1mmergetool.[4m[22m<tool>[24m[1m.cmd [22mvariable is defined.

       [1mmerge.guitool[0m
           Controls which merge tool is used by [1mgit-mergetool[22m(1) when the

           variable value. The default is [1mfalse[22m, where the [1m--gui [22margument must
           be provided explicitly for the [1mmerge.guitool [22mto be used.

       [1mnotes.mergeStrategy[0m
           Which merge strategy to choose by default when resolving notes
           conflicts. Must be one of [1mmanual[22m, [1mours[22m, [1mtheirs[22m, [1munion[22m, or
           [1mcat_sort_uniq[22m. Defaults to [1mmanual[22m. See the "NOTES MERGE STRATEGIES"
           section of [1mgit-notes[22m(1) for more information on each strategy.

           This setting can be overridden by passing the [1m--strategy [22moption to
           [1mgit-notes[22m(1).

       [1mnotes.[4m[22m<name>[24m[1m.mergeStrategy[0m
           Which merge strategy to choose when doing a notes merge into
           [1mrefs/notes/[4m[22m<name>[24m. This overrides the more general
           [1mnotes.mergeStrategy[22m. See the "NOTES MERGE STRATEGIES" section in
           [1mgit-notes[22m(1) for more information on the available strategies.

       [1mnotes.displayRef[0m
           Which ref (or refs, if a glob or specified more than once), in
           addition to the default set by [1mcore.notesRef [22mor [1mGIT_NOTES_REF[22m, to
           read notes from when showing commit messages with the [1mgit log [22mfamily
           of commands.

           This setting can be overridden with the [1mGIT_NOTES_DISPLAY_REF[0m
           environment variable, which must be a colon separated list of refs
           or globs.

           A warning will be issued for refs that do not exist, but a glob that
           does not match any refs is silently ignored.

           This setting can be disabled by the [1m--no-notes [22moption to the [1mgit-[0m
           [1mlog[22m(1) family of commands, or by the [1m--notes=[4m[22m<ref>[24m option accepted
           by those commands.

           The effective value of [1mcore.notesRef [22m(possibly overridden by
           [1mGIT_NOTES_REF[22m) is also implicitly added to the list of refs to be
           displayed.

       [1mnotes.rewrite.[4m[22m<command>[0m
           When rewriting commits with [4m<command>[24m (currently [1mamend [22mor [1mrebase[22m),
           if this variable is [1mfalse[22m, git will not copy notes from the original
           to the rewritten commit. Defaults to [1mtrue[22m. See also [1mnotes.rewriteRef[0m
           below.

           This setting can be overridden with the [1mGIT_NOTES_REWRITE_REF[0m
           environment variable, which must be a colon separated list of refs
           or globs.

       [1mnotes.rewriteMode[0m
           When copying notes during a rewrite (see the [1mnotes.rewrite.[4m[22m<command>[0m
           option), determines what to do if the target commit already has a
           note. Must be one of [1moverwrite[22m, [1mconcatenate[22m, [1mcat_sort_uniq[22m, or
           [1mignore[22m. Defaults to [1mconcatenate[22m.

           This setting can be overridden with the [1mGIT_NOTES_REWRITE_MODE[0m
           environment variable.

       [1mnotes.rewriteRef[0m
           When copying notes during a rewrite, specifies the (fully qualified)
           ref whose notes should be copied. May be a glob, in which case notes
           in all matching refs will be copied. You may also specify this
           configuration several times.

           Does not have a default value; you must configure this variable to
           enable note rewriting. Set it to [1mrefs/notes/commits [22mto enable
           rewriting for the default commit notes.

           Can be overridden with the [1mGIT_NOTES_REWRITE_REF [22menvironment
           variable. See [1mnotes.rewrite.[4m[22m<command>[24m above for a further
           description of its format.

       pack.window
           The size of the window used by [1mgit-pack-objects[22m(1) when no window
           size is given on the command line. Defaults to 10.

       pack.depth
           The maximum delta depth used by [1mgit-pack-objects[22m(1) when no maximum
           depth is given on the command line. Defaults to 50. Maximum value is
           4095.

       pack.windowMemory
           The maximum size of memory that is consumed by each thread in [1mgit-[0m
           [1mpack-objects[22m(1) for pack window memory when no limit is given on the
           command line. The value can be suffixed with "k", "m", or "g". When
           left unconfigured (or set explicitly to 0), there will be no limit.

       pack.compression
           An integer -1..9, indicating the compression level for objects in a
           pack file. -1 is the zlib default. 0 means no compression, and 1..9
           are various speed/size tradeoffs, 9 being slowest. If not set,
           defaults to core.compression. If that is not set, defaults to -1,
           the zlib default, which is "a default compromise between speed and
           compression (currently equivalent to level 6)."

           Note that changing the compression level will not automatically
           recompress all existing objects. You can force recompression by
           passing the -F option to [1mgit-repack[22m(1).

       pack.allowPackReuse
           When true or "single", and when reachability bitmaps are enabled,
           pack-objects will try to send parts of the bitmapped packfile
           verbatim. When "multi", and when a multi-pack reachability bitmap is
           available, pack-objects will try to send parts of all packs in the
           MIDX.

           If only a single pack bitmap is available, and [1mpack.allowPackReuse[0m
           is set to "multi", reuse parts of just the bitmapped packfile. This
           can reduce memory and CPU usage to serve fetches, but might result
           in sending a slightly larger pack. Defaults to true.

       pack.island
           An extended regular expression configuring a set of delta islands.
           See "DELTA ISLANDS" in [1mgit-pack-objects[22m(1) for details.

       pack.islandCore
           Specify an island name which gets to have its objects be packed
           first. This creates a kind of pseudo-pack at the front of one pack,
           so that the objects from the specified island are hopefully faster
           to copy into any pack that should be served to a user requesting
           these objects. In practice this means that the island specified
           should likely correspond to what is the most commonly cloned in the
           repo. See also "DELTA ISLANDS" in [1mgit-pack-objects[22m(1).

       pack.deltaCacheSize
           The maximum memory in bytes used for caching deltas in [1mgit-pack-[0m
           [1mobjects[22m(1) before writing them out to a pack. This cache is used to
           speed up the writing object phase by not having to recompute the
           final delta result once the best match for all objects is found.
           Repacking large repositories on machines which are tight with memory
           might be badly impacted by this though, especially if this cache
           pushes the system into swapping. A value of 0 means no limit. The
           smallest size of 1 byte may be used to virtually disable this cache.
           Defaults to 256 MiB.

       pack.deltaCacheLimit
           The maximum size of a delta, that is cached in [1mgit-pack-objects[22m(1).
           This cache is used to speed up the writing object phase by not
           having to recompute the final delta result once the best match for
           all objects is found. Defaults to 1000. Maximum value is 65535.

       pack.threads
           Specifies the number of threads to spawn when searching for best
           delta matches. This requires that [1mgit-pack-objects[22m(1) be compiled
           with pthreads otherwise this option is ignored with a warning. This
           is meant to reduce packing time on multiprocessor machines. The
           required amount of memory for the delta search window is however
           multiplied by the number of threads. Specifying 0 will cause Git to
           auto-detect the number of CPUs and set the number of threads
           accordingly.

       pack.indexVersion
           Specify the default pack index version. Valid values are 1 for
           legacy pack index used by Git versions prior to 1.5.2, and 2 for the
           new pack index with capabilities for packs larger than 4 GB as well
           as proper protection against the repacking of corrupted packs.
           Version 2 is the default. Note that version 2 is enforced and this
           config option is ignored whenever the corresponding pack is larger
           than 2 GB.

           If you have an old Git that does not understand the version 2 [1m*.idx[0m
           file, cloning or fetching over a non-native protocol (e.g. "http")
           that will copy both [1m*.pack [22mfile and corresponding [1m*.idx [22mfile from
           the other side may give you a repository that cannot be accessed
           with your older version of Git. If the [1m*.pack [22mfile is smaller than 2
           GB, however, you can use [1mgit-index-pack[22m(1) on the *.pack file to
           regenerate the [1m*.idx [22mfile.

       pack.packSizeLimit
           The maximum size of a pack. This setting only affects packing to a
           file when repacking, i.e. the git:// protocol is unaffected. It can
           be overridden by the [1m--max-pack-size [22moption of [1mgit-repack[22m(1).
           Reaching this limit results in the creation of multiple packfiles.

           Note that this option is rarely useful, and may result in a larger
           total on-disk size (because Git will not store deltas between packs)
           and worse runtime performance (object lookup within multiple packs
           is slower than a single pack, and optimizations like reachability
           bitmaps cannot cope with multiple packs).

           If you need to actively run Git using smaller packfiles (e.g.,
           because your filesystem does not support large files), this option
           may help. But if your goal is to transmit a packfile over a medium
           that supports limited sizes (e.g., removable media that cannot store
           the whole repository), you are likely better off creating a single
           large packfile and splitting it using a generic multi-volume archive
           tool (e.g., Unix [1msplit[22m).

           The minimum size allowed is limited to 1 MiB. The default is
           unlimited. Common unit suffixes of [4mk[24m, [4mm[24m, or [4mg[24m are supported.

       pack.useBitmaps
           When true, git will use pack bitmaps (if available) when packing to
           stdout (e.g., during the server side of a fetch). Defaults to true.
           You should not generally need to turn this off unless you are
           debugging pack bitmaps.

       pack.useBitmapBoundaryTraversal
           When true, Git will use an experimental algorithm for computing
           reachability queries with bitmaps. Instead of building up complete
           bitmaps for all of the negated tips and then OR-ing them together,
           consider negated tips with existing bitmaps as additive (i.e. OR-ing
           them into the result if they exist, ignoring them otherwise), and
           build up a bitmap at the boundary instead.

           When using this algorithm, Git may include too many objects as a
           result of not opening up trees belonging to certain UNINTERESTING
           commits. This inexactness matches the non-bitmap traversal
           algorithm.

           In many cases, this can provide a speed-up over the exact algorithm,
           particularly when there is poor bitmap coverage of the negated side
           of the query.

       pack.useSparse
           When true, git will default to using the [4m--sparse[24m option in [4mgit[0m
           [4mpack-objects[24m when the [4m--revs[24m option is present. This algorithm only
           walks trees that appear in paths that introduce new objects. This
           can have significant performance benefits when computing a pack to
           send a small change. However, it is possible that extra objects are
           added to the pack-file if the included commits contain certain types
           of direct renames. Default is [1mtrue[22m.

       pack.usePathWalk
           Enable the [1m--path-walk [22moption by default for [1mgit pack-objects[0m
           processes. See [1mgit-pack-objects[22m(1) for full details.

       pack.preferBitmapTips
           When selecting which commits will receive bitmaps, prefer a commit
           at the tip of any reference that is a suffix of any value of this
           configuration over any other commits in the "selection window".

           Note that setting this configuration to [1mrefs/foo [22mdoes not mean that
           the commits at the tips of [1mrefs/foo/bar [22mand [1mrefs/foo/baz [22mwill
           necessarily be selected. This is because commits are selected for
           bitmaps from within a series of windows of variable length.

           If a commit at the tip of any reference which is a suffix of any
           value of this configuration is seen in a window, it is immediately
           given preference over any other commit in that window.

       pack.writeBitmaps (deprecated)
           This is a deprecated synonym for [1mrepack.writeBitmaps[22m.

       pack.writeBitmapHashCache
           When true, git will include a "hash cache" section in the bitmap
           index (if one is written). This cache can be used to feed git’s
           delta heuristics, potentially leading to better deltas between
           bitmapped and non-bitmapped objects (e.g., when serving a fetch
           between an older, bitmapped pack and objects that have been pushed
           since the last gc). The downside is that it consumes 4 bytes per
           object of disk space. Defaults to true.

           When writing a multi-pack reachability bitmap, no new namehashes are
           computed; instead, any namehashes stored in an existing bitmap are
           permuted into their appropriate location when writing a new bitmap.

       pack.writeBitmapLookupTable
           When true, Git will include a "lookup table" section in the bitmap
           index (if one is written). This table is used to defer loading
           individual bitmaps as late as possible. This can be beneficial in
           repositories that have relatively large bitmap indexes. Defaults to
           false.

       pack.readReverseIndex
           When true, git will read any .rev file(s) that may be available
           (see: [1mgitformat-pack[22m(5)). When false, the reverse index will be
           generated from scratch and stored in memory. Defaults to true.

       pack.writeReverseIndex
           When true, git will write a corresponding .rev file (see: [1mgitformat-[0m
           [1mpack[22m(5)) for each new packfile that it writes in all places except
           for [1mgit-fast-import[22m(1) and in the bulk checkin mechanism. Defaults
           to true.

       pager.<cmd>
           If the value is boolean, turns on or off pagination of the output of
           a particular Git subcommand when writing to a tty. Otherwise, turns
           on pagination for the subcommand using the pager specified by the
           value of [1mpager.[4m[22m<cmd>[24m. If [1m--paginate [22mor [1m--no-pager [22mis specified on
           the command line, it takes precedence over this option. To disable
           pagination for all commands, set [1mcore.pager [22mor [1mGIT_PAGER [22mto [1mcat[22m.

       pretty.<name>
           Alias for a --pretty= format string, as specified in [1mgit-log[22m(1). Any
           aliases defined here can be used just as the built-in pretty formats
           could. For example, running [1mgit config pretty.changelog [22m"format:* [1m%H[0m
           [1m%s[22m" would cause the invocation [1mgit log --pretty=changelog [22mto be
           equivalent to running [1mgit log [22m"--pretty=format:* [1m%H %s[22m". Note that
           an alias with the same name as a built-in format will be silently
           ignored.

       promisor.quiet
           If set to "true" assume [1m--quiet [22mwhen fetching additional objects for
           a partial clone.

       promisor.advertise
           If set to "true", a server will use the "promisor-remote"
           capability, see [1mgitprotocol-v2[22m(5), to advertise the promisor remotes
           it is using, if it uses some. Default is "false", which means the
           "promisor-remote" capability is not advertised.

       promisor.acceptFromServer
           If set to "all", a client will accept all the promisor remotes a
           server might advertise using the "promisor-remote" capability. If
           set to "knownName" the client will accept promisor remotes which are
           already configured on the client and have the same name as those
           advertised by the client. This is not very secure, but could be used
           in a corporate setup where servers and clients are trusted to not
           switch name and URLs. If set to "knownUrl", the client will accept
           promisor remotes which have both the same name and the same URL
           configured on the client as the name and URL advertised by the
           server. This is more secure than "all" or "knownName", so it should
           be used if possible instead of those options. Default is "none",
           which means no promisor remote advertised by a server will be
           accepted. By accepting a promisor remote, the client agrees that the
           server might omit objects that are lazily fetchable from this
           promisor remote from its responses to "fetch" and "clone" requests
           from the client. Name and URL comparisons are case sensitive. See
           [1mgitprotocol-v2[22m(5).

       protocol.allow
           If set, provide a user defined default policy for all protocols
           which don’t explicitly have a policy ([1mprotocol.[4m[22m<name>[24m[1m.allow[22m). By
           default, if unset, known-safe protocols (http, https, git, ssh) have
           a default policy of [1malways[22m, known-dangerous protocols (ext) have a
           default policy of [1mnever[22m, and all other protocols (including file)
           have a default policy of [1muser[22m. Supported policies:

           •   [1malways [22m- protocol is always able to be used.

           •   [1mnever [22m- protocol is never able to be used.

           •   [1muser [22m- protocol is only able to be used when
               [1mGIT_PROTOCOL_FROM_USER [22mis either unset or has a value of 1. This
               policy should be used when you want a protocol to be directly
               usable by the user but don’t want it used by commands which
               execute clone/fetch/push commands without user input, e.g.
               recursive submodule initialization.

       protocol.<name>.allow
           Set a policy to be used by protocol [4m<name>[24m with clone/fetch/push
           commands. See [1mprotocol.allow [22mabove for the available policies.

           The protocol names currently used by git are:

           •   [1mfile[22m: any local file-based path (including [1mfile:// [22mURLs, or
               local paths)

           •   [1mgit[22m: the anonymous git protocol over a direct TCP connection (or
               proxy, if configured)

           •   [1mssh[22m: git over ssh (including [1mhost:path [22msyntax, [1mssh://[22m, etc).

           •   [1mhttp[22m: git over http, both "smart http" and "dumb http". Note
               that this does [4mnot[24m include [1mhttps[22m; if you want to configure both,
               you must do so individually.

           •   any external helpers are named by their protocol (e.g., use [1mhg[0m
               to allow the [1mgit-remote-hg [22mhelper)

       protocol.version
           If set, clients will attempt to communicate with a server using the
           specified protocol version. If the server does not support it,
           communication falls back to version 0. If unset, the default is [1m2[22m.
           Supported versions:

           •   [1m0 [22m- the original wire protocol.

           •   [1m1 [22m- the original wire protocol with the addition of a version
               string in the initial response from the server.

           •   [1m2 [22m- Wire protocol version 2, see [1mgitprotocol-v2[22m(5).

       pull.ff
           By default, Git does not create an extra merge commit when merging a
           commit that is a descendant of the current commit. Instead, the tip
           of the current branch is fast-forwarded. When set to [1mfalse[22m, this
           variable tells Git to create an extra merge commit in such a case
           (equivalent to giving the [1m--no-ff [22moption from the command line).
           When set to [1monly[22m, only such fast-forward merges are allowed
           (equivalent to giving the [1m--ff-only [22moption from the command line).
           This setting overrides [1mmerge.ff [22mwhen pulling.

       pull.rebase
           When true, rebase branches on top of the fetched branch, instead of
           merging the default branch from the default remote when "git pull"
           is run. See "branch.<name>.rebase" for setting this on a per-branch
           basis.

           When [1mmerges [22m(or just [4mm[24m), pass the [1m--rebase-merges [22moption to [4mgit[0m
           [4mrebase[24m so that the local merge commits are included in the rebase
           (see [1mgit-rebase[22m(1) for details).

           When the value is [1minteractive [22m(or just [4mi[24m), the rebase is run in
           interactive mode.

           [1mNOTE[22m: this is a possibly dangerous operation; do [1mnot [22muse it unless
           you understand the implications (see [1mgit-rebase[22m(1) for details).

       pull.octopus
           The default merge strategy to use when pulling multiple branches at
           once.

       pull.autoStash
           When set to true, automatically create a temporary stash entry to
           record the local changes before the operation begins, and restore
           them after the operation completes. When your "git pull" rebases
           (instead of merges), this may be convenient, since unlike merging
           pull that tolerates local changes that do not interfere with the
           merge, rebasing pull refuses to work with any local changes.

           If [1mpull.autostash [22mis set (either to true or false), [1mmerge.autostash[0m
           and [1mrebase.autostash [22mare ignored. If [1mpull.autostash [22mis not set at
           all, depending on the value of [1mpull.rebase[22m, [1mmerge.autostash [22mor
           [1mrebase.autostash [22mis used instead. Can be overridden by the
           [1m--[22m[[1mno-[22m][1mautostash [22mcommand line option.

       pull.twohead
           The default merge strategy to use when pulling a single branch.

       push.autoSetupRemote
           If set to "true" assume [1m--set-upstream [22mon default push when no
           upstream tracking exists for the current branch; this option takes
           effect with push.default options [4msimple[24m, [4mupstream[24m, and [4mcurrent[24m. It
           is useful if by default you want new branches to be pushed to the
           default remote (like the behavior of [4mpush.default=current[24m) and you
           also want the upstream tracking to be set. Workflows most likely to
           benefit from this option are [4msimple[24m central workflows where all
           branches are expected to have the same name on the remote.

       push.default
           Defines the action [1mgit push [22mshould take if no refspec is given
           (whether from the command-line, config, or elsewhere). Different
           values are well-suited for specific workflows; for instance, in a
           purely central workflow (i.e. the fetch source is equal to the push
           destination), [1mupstream [22mis probably what you want. Possible values
           are:

           •   [1mnothing [22m- do not push anything (error out) unless a refspec is
               given. This is primarily meant for people who want to avoid
               mistakes by always being explicit.

           •   [1mcurrent [22m- push the current branch to update a branch with the
               same name on the receiving end. Works in both central and
               non-central workflows.

           •   [1mupstream [22m- push the current branch back to the branch whose
               changes are usually integrated into the current branch (which is
               called [1m@[22m{upstream}). This mode only makes sense if you are
               pushing to the same repository you would normally pull from
               (i.e. central workflow).

           •   [1mtracking [22m- This is a deprecated synonym for [1mupstream[22m.

           •   [1msimple [22m- push the current branch with the same name on the
               remote.

               If you are working on a centralized workflow (pushing to the
               same repository you pull from, which is typically [1morigin[22m), then
               you need to configure an upstream branch with the same name.

               This mode is the default since Git 2.0, and is the safest option
               suited for beginners.

           •   [1mmatching [22m- push all branches having the same name on both ends.
               This makes the repository you are pushing to remember the set of
               branches that will be pushed out (e.g. if you always push [4mmaint[0m
               and [4mmaster[24m there and no other branches, the repository you push
               to will have these two branches, and your local [4mmaint[24m and [4mmaster[0m
               will be pushed there).

               To use this mode effectively, you have to make sure [4mall[24m the
               branches you would push out are ready to be pushed out before
               running [4mgit[24m [4mpush[24m, as the whole point of this mode is to allow
               you to push all of the branches in one go. If you usually finish
               work on only one branch and push out the result, while other
               branches are unfinished, this mode is not for you. Also this
               mode is not suitable for pushing into a shared central
               repository, as other people may add new branches there, or
               update the tip of existing branches outside your control.

               This used to be the default, but not since Git 2.0 ([1msimple [22mis
               the new default).

       push.followTags
           If set to true, enable [1m--follow-tags [22moption by default. You may
           override this configuration at time of push by specifying
           [1m--no-follow-tags[22m.

       push.gpgSign
           May be set to a boolean value, or the string [4mif-asked[24m. A true value
           causes all pushes to be GPG signed, as if [1m--signed [22mis passed to [1mgit-[0m
           [1mpush[22m(1). The string [4mif-asked[24m causes pushes to be signed if the
           server supports it, as if [1m--signed=if-asked [22mis passed to [4mgit[24m [4mpush[24m. A
           false value may override a value from a lower-priority config file.
           An explicit command-line flag always overrides this config option.

       push.pushOption
           When no [1m--push-option=[4m[22m<option>[24m argument is given from the command
           line, [1mgit push [22mbehaves as if each <value> of this variable is given
           as [1m--push-option=[4m[22m<value>[24m.

           This is a multi-valued variable, and an empty value can be used in a
           higher priority configuration file (e.g.  [1m.git/config [22min a
           repository) to clear the values inherited from a lower priority
           configuration files (e.g.  [1m$HOME/.gitconfig[22m).

               Example:

               /etc/gitconfig
                 push.pushoption = a
                 push.pushoption = b

               ~/.gitconfig
                 push.pushoption = c

               repo/.git/config
                 push.pushoption =
                 push.pushoption = b

               This will result in only b (a and c are cleared).

       push.recurseSubmodules
           May be "check", "on-demand", "only", or "no", with the same behavior
           as that of "push --recurse-submodules". If not set, [4mno[24m is used by
           default, unless [4msubmodule.recurse[24m is set (in which case a [4mtrue[24m value
           means [4mon-demand[24m).

       push.useForceIfIncludes
           If set to "true", it is equivalent to specifying [1m--force-if-includes[0m
           as an option to [1mgit-push[22m(1) in the command line. Adding
           [1m--no-force-if-includes [22mat the time of push overrides this
           configuration setting.

       push.negotiate
           If set to "true", attempt to reduce the size of the packfile sent by
           rounds of negotiation in which the client and the server attempt to
           find commits in common. If "false", Git will rely solely on the
           server’s ref advertisement to find commits in common.

       push.useBitmaps
           If set to "false", disable use of bitmaps for "git push" even if
           [1mpack.useBitmaps [22mis "true", without preventing other git operations
           from using bitmaps. Default is true.

       rebase.backend
           Default backend to use for rebasing. Possible choices are [4mapply[24m or
           [4mmerge[24m. In the future, if the merge backend gains all remaining
           capabilities of the apply backend, this setting may become unused.

       rebase.stat
           Whether to show a diffstat of what changed upstream since the last
           rebase. False by default.

       rebase.autoSquash
           If set to true, enable the [1m--autosquash [22moption of [1mgit-rebase[22m(1) by
           default for interactive mode. This can be overridden with the
           [1m--no-autosquash [22moption.

       rebase.autoStash
           When set to true, automatically create a temporary stash entry
           before the operation begins, and apply it after the operation ends.
           This means that you can run rebase on a dirty worktree. However, use
           with care: the final stash application after a successful rebase
           might result in non-trivial conflicts. This option can be overridden
           by the [1m--no-autostash [22mand [1m--autostash [22moptions of [1mgit-rebase[22m(1).
           Defaults to false.

       rebase.updateRefs
           If set to true enable [1m--update-refs [22moption by default.

       rebase.missingCommitsCheck
           If set to "warn", git rebase -i will print a warning if some commits
           are removed (e.g. a line was deleted), however the rebase will still
           proceed. If set to "error", it will print the previous warning and
           stop the rebase, [4mgit[24m [4mrebase[24m [4m--edit-todo[24m can then be used to correct
           the error. If set to "ignore", no checking is done. To drop a commit
           without warning or error, use the [1mdrop [22mcommand in the todo list.
           Defaults to "ignore".

       rebase.instructionFormat
           A format string, as specified in [1mgit-log[22m(1), to be used for the todo
           list during an interactive rebase. The format will automatically
           have the commit hash prepended to the format.

       rebase.abbreviateCommands
           If set to true, [1mgit rebase [22mwill use abbreviated command names in the
           todo list resulting in something like this:

                       p deadbee The oneline of the commit
                       p fa1afe1 The oneline of the next commit
                       ...

           instead of:

                       pick deadbee The oneline of the commit
                       pick fa1afe1 The oneline of the next commit
                       ...

           Defaults to false.

       rebase.rescheduleFailedExec
           Automatically reschedule [1mexec [22mcommands that failed. This only makes
           sense in interactive mode (or when an [1m--exec [22moption was provided).
           This is the same as specifying the [1m--reschedule-failed-exec [22moption.

       rebase.forkPoint
           If set to false set [1m--no-fork-point [22moption by default.

       rebase.rebaseMerges
           Whether and how to set the [1m--rebase-merges [22moption by default. Can be
           [1mrebase-cousins[22m, [1mno-rebase-cousins[22m, or a boolean. Setting to true or
           to [1mno-rebase-cousins [22mis equivalent to
           [1m--rebase-merges=no-rebase-cousins[22m, setting to [1mrebase-cousins [22mis
           equivalent to [1m--rebase-merges=rebase-cousins[22m, and setting to false
           is equivalent to [1m--no-rebase-merges[22m. Passing [1m--rebase-merges [22mon the
           command line, with or without an argument, overrides any
           [1mrebase.rebaseMerges [22mconfiguration.

       rebase.maxLabelLength
           When generating label names from commit subjects, truncate the names
           to this length. By default, the names are truncated to a little less
           than [1mNAME_MAX [22m(to allow e.g.  [1m.lock [22mfiles to be written for the
           corresponding loose refs).

       receive.advertiseAtomic
           By default, git-receive-pack will advertise the atomic push
           capability to its clients. If you don’t want to advertise this
           capability, set this variable to false.

       receive.advertisePushOptions
           When set to true, git-receive-pack will advertise the push options
           capability to its clients. False by default.

       receive.autogc
           By default, git-receive-pack will run "git maintenance run --auto"
           after receiving data from git-push and updating refs. You can stop
           it by setting this variable to false.

       receive.certNonceSeed
           By setting this variable to a string, [1mgit receive-pack [22mwill accept a
           [1mgit push --signed [22mand verify it by using a "nonce" protected by HMAC
           using this string as a secret key.

       receive.certNonceSlop
           When a [1mgit push --signed [22msends a push certificate with a "nonce"
           that was issued by a receive-pack serving the same repository within
           this many seconds, export the "nonce" found in the certificate to
           [1mGIT_PUSH_CERT_NONCE [22mto the hooks (instead of what the receive-pack
           asked the sending side to include). This may allow writing checks in
           [1mpre-receive [22mand [1mpost-receive [22ma bit easier. Instead of checking
           [1mGIT_PUSH_CERT_NONCE_SLOP [22menvironment variable that records by how
           many seconds the nonce is stale to decide if they want to accept the
           certificate, they only can check [1mGIT_PUSH_CERT_NONCE_STATUS [22mis [1mOK[22m.

       receive.fsckObjects
           If it is set to true, git-receive-pack will check all received
           objects. See [1mtransfer.fsckObjects [22mfor what’s checked. Defaults to
           false. If not set, the value of [1mtransfer.fsckObjects [22mis used
           instead.

       receive.fsck.<msg-id>
           Acts like [1mfsck.[4m[22m<msg-id>[24m, but is used by [1mgit-receive-pack[22m(1) instead
           of [1mgit-fsck[22m(1). See the [1mfsck.[4m[22m<msg-id>[24m documentation for details.

       receive.fsck.skipList
           Acts like [1mfsck.skipList[22m, but is used by [1mgit-receive-pack[22m(1) instead
           of [1mgit-fsck[22m(1). See the [1mfsck.skipList [22mdocumentation for details.

       receive.keepAlive
           After receiving the pack from the client, [1mreceive-pack [22mmay produce
           no output (if [1m--quiet [22mwas specified) while processing the pack,
           causing some networks to drop the TCP connection. With this option
           set, if [1mreceive-pack [22mdoes not transmit any data in this phase for
           [1mreceive.keepAlive [22mseconds, it will send a short keepalive packet.
           The default is 5 seconds; set to 0 to disable keepalives entirely.

       receive.unpackLimit
           If the number of objects received in a push is below this limit then
           the objects will be unpacked into loose object files. However if the
           number of received objects equals or exceeds this limit then the
           received pack will be stored as a pack, after adding any missing
           delta bases. Storing the pack from a push can make the push
           operation complete faster, especially on slow filesystems. If not
           set, the value of [1mtransfer.unpackLimit [22mis used instead.

       receive.maxInputSize
           If the size of the incoming pack stream is larger than this limit,
           then git-receive-pack will error out, instead of accepting the pack
           file. If not set or set to 0, then the size is unlimited.

       receive.denyDeletes
           If set to true, git-receive-pack will deny a ref update that deletes
           the ref. Use this to prevent such a ref deletion via a push.

       receive.denyDeleteCurrent
           If set to true, git-receive-pack will deny a ref update that deletes
           the currently checked out branch of a non-bare repository.

       receive.denyCurrentBranch
           If set to true or "refuse", git-receive-pack will deny a ref update
           to the currently checked out branch of a non-bare repository. Such a
           push is potentially dangerous because it brings the HEAD out of sync
           with the index and working tree. If set to "warn", print a warning
           of such a push to stderr, but allow the push to proceed. If set to
           false or "ignore", allow such pushes with no message. Defaults to
           "refuse".

           Another option is "updateInstead" which will update the working tree
           if pushing into the current branch. This option is intended for
           synchronizing working directories when one side is not easily
           accessible via interactive ssh (e.g. a live web site, hence the
           requirement that the working directory be clean). This mode also
           comes in handy when developing inside a VM to test and fix code on
           different Operating Systems.

           By default, "updateInstead" will refuse the push if the working tree
           or the index have any difference from the HEAD, but the
           [1mpush-to-checkout [22mhook can be used to customize this. See
           [1mgithooks[22m(5).

       receive.denyNonFastForwards
           If set to true, git-receive-pack will deny a ref update which is not
           a fast-forward. Use this to prevent such an update via a push, even
           if that push is forced. This configuration variable is set when
           initializing a shared repository.

       receive.hideRefs
           This variable is the same as [1mtransfer.hideRefs[22m, but applies only to
           [1mreceive-pack [22m(and so affects pushes, but not fetches). An attempt to
           update or delete a hidden ref by [1mgit push [22mis rejected.

       receive.procReceiveRefs
           This is a multi-valued variable that defines reference prefixes to
           match the commands in [1mreceive-pack[22m. Commands matching the prefixes
           will be executed by an external hook "proc-receive", instead of the
           internal [1mexecute_commands [22mfunction. If this variable is not defined,
           the "proc-receive" hook will never be used, and all commands will be
           executed by the internal [1mexecute_commands [22mfunction.

           For example, if this variable is set to "refs/for", pushing to
           reference such as "refs/for/master" will not create or update a
           reference named "refs/for/master", but may create or update a pull
           request directly by running the hook "proc-receive".

           Optional modifiers can be provided in the beginning of the value to
           filter commands for specific actions: create (a), modify (m), delete
           (d). A ! can be included in the modifiers to negate the reference
           prefix entry. E.g.:

               git config --system --add receive.procReceiveRefs ad:refs/heads
               git config --system --add receive.procReceiveRefs !:refs/heads

       receive.updateServerInfo
           If set to true, git-receive-pack will run git-update-server-info
           after receiving data from git-push and updating refs.

       receive.shallowUpdate
           If set to true, .git/shallow can be updated when new refs require
           new shallow roots. Otherwise those refs are rejected.

       reftable.blockSize
           The size in bytes used by the reftable backend when writing blocks.
           The block size is determined by the writer, and does not have to be
           a power of 2. The block size must be larger than the longest
           reference name or log entry used in the repository, as references
           cannot span blocks.

           Powers of two that are friendly to the virtual memory system or
           filesystem (such as 4kB or 8kB) are recommended. Larger sizes (64kB)
           can yield better compression, with a possible increased cost
           incurred by readers during access.

           The largest block size is [1m16777215 [22mbytes (15.99 MiB). The default
           value is [1m4096 [22mbytes (4kB). A value of [1m0 [22mwill use the default value.

       reftable.restartInterval
           The interval at which to create restart points. The reftable backend
           determines the restart points at file creation. Every 16 may be more
           suitable for smaller block sizes (4k or 8k), every 64 for larger
           block sizes (64k).

           More frequent restart points reduces prefix compression and
           increases space consumed by the restart table, both of which
           increase file size.

           Less frequent restart points makes prefix compression more
           effective, decreasing overall file size, with increased penalties
           for readers walking through more records after the binary search
           step.

           A maximum of [1m65535 [22mrestart points per block is supported.

           The default value is to create restart points every 16 records. A
           value of [1m0 [22mwill use the default value.

       reftable.indexObjects
           Whether the reftable backend shall write object blocks. Object
           blocks are a reverse mapping of object ID to the references pointing
           to them.

           The default value is [1mtrue[22m.

       reftable.geometricFactor
           Whenever the reftable backend appends a new table to the stack, it
           performs auto compaction to ensure that there is only a handful of
           tables. The backend does this by ensuring that tables form a
           geometric sequence regarding the respective sizes of each table.

           By default, the geometric sequence uses a factor of 2, meaning that
           for any table, the next-biggest table must at least be twice as big.
           A maximum factor of 256 is supported.

       reftable.lockTimeout
           Whenever the reftable backend appends a new table to the stack, it
           has to lock the central "tables.list" file before updating it. This
           config controls how long the process will wait to acquire the lock
           in case another process has already acquired it. Value 0 means not
           to retry at all; -1 means to try indefinitely. Default is 100 (i.e.,
           retry for 100ms).

       remote.pushDefault
           The remote to push to by default. Overrides [1mbranch.[4m[22m<name>[24m[1m.remote [22mfor
           all branches, and is overridden by [1mbranch.[4m[22m<name>[24m[1m.pushRemote [22mfor
           specific branches.

       remote.<name>.url
           The URL of a remote repository. See [1mgit-fetch[22m(1) or [1mgit-push[22m(1). A
           configured remote can have multiple URLs; in this case the first is
           used for fetching, and all are used for pushing (assuming no
           [1mremote.[4m[22m<name>[24m[1m.pushurl [22mis defined). Setting this key to the empty
           string clears the list of urls, allowing you to override earlier
           config.

       remote.<name>.pushurl
           The push URL of a remote repository. See [1mgit-push[22m(1). If a [1mpushurl[0m
           option is present in a configured remote, it is used for pushing
           instead of [1mremote.[4m[22m<name>[24m[1m.url[22m. A configured remote can have multiple
           push URLs; in this case a push goes to all of them. Setting this key
           to the empty string clears the list of urls, allowing you to
           override earlier config.

       remote.<name>.proxy
           For remotes that require curl (http, https and ftp), the URL to the
           proxy to use for that remote. Set to the empty string to disable
           proxying for that remote.

       remote.<name>.proxyAuthMethod
           For remotes that require curl (http, https and ftp), the method to
           use for authenticating against the proxy in use (probably set in
           [1mremote.[4m[22m<name>[24m[1m.proxy[22m). See [1mhttp.proxyAuthMethod[22m.

       remote.<name>.fetch
           The default set of "refspec" for [1mgit-fetch[22m(1). See [1mgit-fetch[22m(1).

       remote.<name>.push
           The default set of "refspec" for [1mgit-push[22m(1). See [1mgit-push[22m(1).

       remote.<name>.mirror
           If true, pushing to this remote will automatically behave as if the
           [1m--mirror [22moption was given on the command line.

       remote.<name>.skipDefaultUpdate
           A deprecated synonym to [1mremote.[4m[22m<name>[24m[1m.skipFetchAll [22m(if both are set
           in the configuration files with different values, the value of the
           last occurrence will be used).

       remote.<name>.skipFetchAll
           If true, this remote will be skipped when updating using [1mgit-[0m
           [1mfetch[22m(1), the [1mupdate [22msubcommand of [1mgit-remote[22m(1), and ignored by the
           prefetch task of [1mgit maintenance[22m.

       remote.<name>.receivepack
           The default program to execute on the remote side when pushing. See
           option --receive-pack of [1mgit-push[22m(1).

       remote.<name>.uploadpack
           The default program to execute on the remote side when fetching. See
           option --upload-pack of [1mgit-fetch-pack[22m(1).

       remote.<name>.tagOpt
           Setting this value to --no-tags disables automatic tag following
           when fetching from remote <name>. Setting it to --tags will fetch
           every tag from remote <name>, even if they are not reachable from
           remote branch heads. Passing these flags directly to [1mgit-fetch[22m(1)
           can override this setting. See options --tags and --no-tags of [1mgit-[0m
           [1mfetch[22m(1).

       remote.<name>.vcs
           Setting this to a value <vcs> will cause Git to interact with the
           remote with the git-remote-<vcs> helper.

       remote.<name>.prune
           When set to true, fetching from this remote by default will also
           remove any remote-tracking references that no longer exist on the
           remote (as if the [1m--prune [22moption was given on the command line).
           Overrides [1mfetch.prune [22msettings, if any.

       remote.<name>.pruneTags
           When set to true, fetching from this remote by default will also
           remove any local tags that no longer exist on the remote if pruning
           is activated in general via [1mremote.[4m[22m<name>[24m[1m.prune[22m, [1mfetch.prune [22mor
           [1m--prune[22m. Overrides [1mfetch.pruneTags [22msettings, if any.

           See also [1mremote.[4m[22m<name>[24m[1m.prune [22mand the PRUNING section of [1mgit-[0m
           [1mfetch[22m(1).

       remote.<name>.promisor
           When set to true, this remote will be used to fetch promisor
           objects.

       remote.<name>.partialclonefilter
           The filter that will be applied when fetching from this promisor
           remote. Changing or clearing this value will only affect fetches for
           new commits. To fetch associated objects for commits already present
           in the local object database, use the [1m--refetch [22moption of [1mgit-[0m
           [1mfetch[22m(1).

       remote.<name>.serverOption
           The default set of server options used when fetching from this
           remote. These server options can be overridden by the
           [1m--server-option= [22mcommand line arguments.

           This is a multi-valued variable, and an empty value can be used in a
           higher priority configuration file (e.g.  [1m.git/config [22min a
           repository) to clear the values inherited from a lower priority
           configuration files (e.g.  [1m$HOME/.gitconfig[22m).

       remote.<name>.followRemoteHEAD
           How [1mgit-fetch[22m(1) should handle updates to [1mremotes/[4m[22m<name>[24m[1m/HEAD [22mwhen
           fetching using the configured refspecs of a remote. The default
           value is "create", which will create [1mremotes/[4m[22m<name>[24m[1m/HEAD [22mif it
           exists on the remote, but not locally; this will not touch an
           already existing local reference. Setting it to "warn" will print a
           message if the remote has a different value than the local one; in
           case there is no local reference, it behaves like "create". A
           variant on "warn" is "warn-if-not-$branch", which behaves like
           "warn", but if [1mHEAD [22mon the remote is [1m$branch [22mit will be silent.
           Setting it to "always" will silently update [1mremotes/[4m[22m<name>[24m[1m/HEAD [22mto
           the value on the remote. Finally, setting it to "never" will never
           change or create the local reference.

       remotes.<group>
           The list of remotes which are fetched by "git remote update
           <group>". See [1mgit-remote[22m(1).

       repack.useDeltaBaseOffset
           By default, [1mgit-repack[22m(1) creates packs that use delta-base offset.
           If you need to share your repository with Git older than version
           1.4.4, either directly or via a dumb protocol such as http, then you
           need to set this option to "false" and repack. Access from old Git
           versions over the native protocol are unaffected by this option.

       repack.packKeptObjects
           If set to true, makes [1mgit repack [22mact as if [1m--pack-kept-objects [22mwas
           passed. See [1mgit-repack[22m(1) for details. Defaults to [1mfalse [22mnormally,
           but [1mtrue [22mif a bitmap index is being written (either via
           [1m--write-bitmap-index [22mor [1mrepack.writeBitmaps[22m).

       repack.useDeltaIslands
           If set to true, makes [1mgit repack [22mact as if [1m--delta-islands [22mwas
           passed. Defaults to [1mfalse[22m.

       repack.writeBitmaps
           When true, git will write a bitmap index when packing all objects to
           disk (e.g., when [1mgit repack -a [22mis run). This index can speed up the
           "counting objects" phase of subsequent packs created for clones and
           fetches, at the cost of some disk space and extra time spent on the
           initial repack. This has no effect if multiple packfiles are
           created. Defaults to true on bare repos, false otherwise.

       repack.updateServerInfo
           If set to false, [1mgit-repack[22m(1) will not run [1mgit-update-server-[0m
           [1minfo[22m(1). Defaults to true. Can be overridden when true by the [1m-n[0m
           option of [1mgit-repack[22m(1).

       repack.cruftWindow, repack.cruftWindowMemory, repack.cruftDepth,
       repack.cruftThreads
           Parameters used by [1mgit-pack-objects[22m(1) when generating a cruft pack
           and the respective parameters are not given over the command line.
           See similarly named [1mpack.*  [22mconfiguration variables for defaults and
           meaning.

       repack.midxMustContainCruft
           When set to true, [1mgit-repack[22m(1) will unconditionally include cruft
           pack(s), if any, in the multi-pack index when invoked with
           [1m--write-midx[22m. When false, cruft packs are only included in the MIDX
           when necessary (e.g., because they might be required to form a
           reachability closure with MIDX bitmaps). Defaults to true.

       rerere.autoUpdate
           When set to true, [1mgit-rerere [22mupdates the index with the resulting
           contents after it cleanly resolves conflicts using previously
           recorded resolutions. Defaults to false.

       rerere.enabled
           Activate recording of resolved conflicts, so that identical conflict
           hunks can be resolved automatically, should they be encountered
           again. By default, [1mgit-rerere[22m(1) is enabled if there is an [1mrr-cache[0m
           directory under the [1m$GIT_DIR[22m, e.g. if "rerere" was previously used
           in the repository.

       revert.reference
           Setting this variable to true makes [1mgit revert [22mbehave as if the
           [1m--reference [22moption is given.

       safe.bareRepository
           Specifies which bare repositories Git will work with. The currently
           supported values are:

           •   [1mall[22m: Git works with all bare repositories. This is the default.

           •   [1mexplicit[22m: Git only works with bare repositories specified via
               the top-level [1m--git-dir [22mcommand-line option, or the [1mGIT_DIR[0m
               environment variable (see [1mgit[22m(1)).

               If you do not use bare repositories in your workflow, then it
               may be beneficial to set [1msafe.bareRepository [22mto [1mexplicit [22min your
               global config. This will protect you from attacks that involve
               cloning a repository that contains a bare repository and running
               a Git command within that directory.

               This config setting is only respected in protected configuration
               (see the section called “SCOPES”). This prevents untrusted
               repositories from tampering with this value.

       safe.directory
           These config entries specify Git-tracked directories that are
           considered safe even if they are owned by someone other than the
           current user. By default, Git will refuse to even parse a Git config
           of a repository owned by someone else, let alone run its hooks, and
           this config setting allows users to specify exceptions, e.g. for
           intentionally shared repositories (see the [1m--shared [22moption in [1mgit-[0m
           [1minit[22m(1)).

           This is a multi-valued setting, i.e. you can add more than one
           directory via [1mgit config --add[22m. To reset the list of safe
           directories (e.g. to override any such directories specified in the
           system config), add a [1msafe.directory [22mentry with an empty value.

           This config setting is only respected in protected configuration
           (see the section called “SCOPES”). This prevents untrusted
           repositories from tampering with this value.

           The value of this setting is interpolated, i.e.  [1m~/[4m[22m<path>[24m expands to
           a path relative to the home directory and [1m%[22m([1mprefix[22m)[1m/[4m[22m<path>[24m expands
           to a path relative to Git’s (runtime) prefix.

           To completely opt-out of this security check, set [1msafe.directory [22mto
           the string [1m*[22m. This will allow all repositories to be treated as if
           their directory was listed in the [1msafe.directory [22mlist. If
           [1msafe.directory=* [22mis set in system config and you want to re-enable
           this protection, then initialize your list with an empty value
           before listing the repositories that you deem safe. Giving a
           directory with [1m/* [22mappended to it will allow access to all
           repositories under the named directory.

           As explained, Git only allows you to access repositories owned by
           yourself, i.e. the user who is running Git, by default. When Git is
           running as [4mroot[24m in a non Windows platform that provides sudo,
           however, git checks the SUDO_UID environment variable that sudo
           creates and will allow access to the uid recorded as its value in
           addition to the id from [4mroot[24m. This is to make it easy to perform a
           common sequence during installation "make && sudo make install". A
           git process running under [4msudo[24m runs as [4mroot[24m but the [4msudo[24m command
           exports the environment variable to record which id the original
           user has. If that is not what you would prefer and want git to only
           trust repositories that are owned by root instead, then you can
           remove the [1mSUDO_UID [22mvariable from root’s environment before invoking
           git.

       sendemail.identity
           A configuration identity. When given, causes values in the
           [1msendemail.[4m[22m<identity>[24m subsection to take precedence over values in
           the [1msendemail [22msection. The default identity is the value of
           [1msendemail.identity[22m.

       sendemail.smtpEncryption
           See [1mgit-send-email[22m(1) for description. Note that this setting is not
           subject to the [1midentity [22mmechanism.

       sendemail.smtpSSLCertPath
           Path to ca-certificates (either a directory or a single file). Set
           it to an empty string to disable certificate verification.

       sendemail.<identity>.*
           Identity-specific versions of the [1msendemail.*  [22mparameters found
           below, taking precedence over those when this identity is selected,
           through either the command-line or [1msendemail.identity[22m.

       sendemail.multiEdit
           If [1mtrue [22m(default), a single editor instance will be spawned to edit
           files you have to edit (patches when [1m--annotate [22mis used, and the
           summary when [1m--compose [22mis used). If [1mfalse[22m, files will be edited one
           after the other, spawning a new editor each time.

       sendemail.confirm
           Sets the default for whether to confirm before sending. Must be one
           of [1malways[22m, [1mnever[22m, [1mcc[22m, [1mcompose[22m, or [1mauto[22m. See [1m--confirm [22min the [1mgit-[0m
           [1msend-email[22m(1) documentation for the meaning of these values.

       sendemail.mailmap
           If [1mtrue[22m, makes [1mgit-send-email[22m(1) assume [1m--mailmap[22m, otherwise assume
           [1m--no-mailmap[22m.  [1mFalse [22mby default.

       sendemail.mailmap.file
           The location of a [1mgit-send-email[22m(1) specific augmenting mailmap
           file. The default mailmap and [1mmailmap.file [22mare loaded first. Thus,
           entries in this file take precedence over entries in the default
           mailmap locations. See [1mgitmailmap[22m(5).

       sendemail.mailmap.blob
           Like [1msendemail.mailmap.file[22m, but consider the value as a reference
           to a blob in the repository. Entries in [1msendemail.mailmap.file [22mtake
           precedence over entries here. See [1mgitmailmap[22m(5).

       sendemail.aliasesFile
           To avoid typing long email addresses, point this to one or more
           email aliases files. You must also supply [1msendemail.aliasFileType[22m.

       sendemail.aliasFileType
           Format of the file(s) specified in sendemail.aliasesFile. Must be
           one of [1mmutt[22m, [1mmailrc[22m, [1mpine[22m, [1melm[22m, [1mgnus[22m, or [1msendmail[22m.

           What an alias file in each format looks like can be found in the
           documentation of the email program of the same name. The differences
           and limitations from the standard formats are described below:

           sendmail

               •   Quoted aliases and quoted addresses are not supported: lines
                   that contain a " symbol are ignored.

               •   Redirection to a file ([1m/path/name[22m) or pipe (|[1mcommand[22m) is not
                   supported.

               •   File inclusion ([1m:include: /path/name[22m) is not supported.

               •   Warnings are printed on the standard error output for any
                   explicitly unsupported constructs, and any other lines that
                   are not recognized by the parser.

       sendemail.outlookidfix
           If [1mtrue[22m, makes [1mgit-send-email[22m(1) assume [1m--outlook-id-fix[22m, and if
           [1mfalse [22massume [1m--no-outlook-id-fix[22m. If not specified, it will behave
           the same way as if [1m--outlook-id-fix [22mis not specified.

       sendemail.signedOffCc (deprecated)
           Deprecated alias for [1msendemail.signedOffByCc[22m.

       sendemail.smtpBatchSize
           Number of messages to be sent per connection, after that a relogin
           will happen. If the value is [1m0 [22mor undefined, send all messages in
           one connection. See also the [1m--batch-size [22moption of [1mgit-send-[0m
           [1memail[22m(1).

       sendemail.smtpReloginDelay
           Seconds to wait before reconnecting to the smtp server. See also the
           [1m--relogin-delay [22moption of [1mgit-send-email[22m(1).

       sendemail.forbidSendmailVariables
           To avoid common misconfiguration mistakes, [1mgit-send-email[22m(1) will
           abort with a warning if any configuration options for [1msendmail[0m
           exist. Set this variable to bypass the check.

       sequence.editor
           Text editor used by [1mgit rebase -i [22mfor editing the rebase instruction
           file. The value is meant to be interpreted by the shell when it is
           used. It can be overridden by the [1mGIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR [22menvironment
           variable. When not configured, the default commit message editor is
           used instead.

       showBranch.default
           The default set of branches for [1mgit-show-branch[22m(1). See [1mgit-show-[0m
           [1mbranch[22m(1).

       sparse.expectFilesOutsideOfPatterns
           Typically with sparse checkouts, files not matching any sparsity
           patterns are marked with a SKIP_WORKTREE bit in the index and are
           missing from the working tree. Accordingly, Git will ordinarily
           check whether files with the SKIP_WORKTREE bit are in fact present
           in the working tree contrary to expectations. If Git finds any, it
           marks those paths as present by clearing the relevant SKIP_WORKTREE
           bits. This option can be used to tell Git that such
           present-despite-skipped files are expected and to stop checking for
           them.

           The default is [1mfalse[22m, which allows Git to automatically recover from
           the list of files in the index and working tree falling out of sync.

           Set this to [1mtrue [22mif you are in a setup where some external factor
           relieves Git of the responsibility for maintaining the consistency
           between the presence of working tree files and sparsity patterns.
           For example, if you have a Git-aware virtual file system that has a
           robust mechanism for keeping the working tree and the sparsity
           patterns up to date based on access patterns.

           Regardless of this setting, Git does not check for
           present-despite-skipped files unless sparse checkout is enabled, so
           this config option has no effect unless [1mcore.sparseCheckout [22mis [1mtrue[22m.

       splitIndex.maxPercentChange
           When the split index feature is used, this specifies the percent of
           entries the split index can contain compared to the total number of
           entries in both the split index and the shared index before a new
           shared index is written. The value should be between 0 and 100. If
           the value is 0, then a new shared index is always written; if it is
           100, a new shared index is never written. By default, the value is
           20, so a new shared index is written if the number of entries in the
           split index would be greater than 20 percent of the total number of
           entries. See [1mgit-update-index[22m(1).

       splitIndex.sharedIndexExpire
           When the split index feature is used, shared index files that were
           not modified since the time this variable specifies will be removed
           when a new shared index file is created. The value "now" expires all
           entries immediately, and "never" suppresses expiration altogether.
           The default value is "2.weeks.ago". Note that a shared index file is
           considered modified (for the purpose of expiration) each time a new
           split-index file is either created based on it or read from it. See
           [1mgit-update-index[22m(1).

       ssh.variant
           By default, Git determines the command line arguments to use based
           on the basename of the configured SSH command (configured using the
           environment variable [1mGIT_SSH [22mor [1mGIT_SSH_COMMAND [22mor the config
           setting [1mcore.sshCommand[22m). If the basename is unrecognized, Git will
           attempt to detect support of OpenSSH options by first invoking the
           configured SSH command with the [1m-G [22m(print configuration) option and
           will subsequently use OpenSSH options (if that is successful) or no
           options besides the host and remote command (if it fails).

           The config variable [1mssh.variant [22mcan be set to override this
           detection. Valid values are [1mssh [22m(to use OpenSSH options), [1mplink[22m,
           [1mputty[22m, [1mtortoiseplink[22m, [1msimple [22m(no options except the host and remote
           command). The default auto-detection can be explicitly requested
           using the value [1mauto[22m. Any other value is treated as [1mssh[22m. This
           setting can also be overridden via the environment variable
           [1mGIT_SSH_VARIANT[22m.

           The current command-line parameters used for each variant are as
           follows:

           •   [1mssh [22m- [-p port] [-4] [-6] [-o option] [username@]host command

           •   [1msimple [22m- [username@]host command

           •   [1mplink [22mor [1mputty [22m- [-P port] [-4] [-6] [username@]host command

           •   [1mtortoiseplink [22m- [-P port] [-4] [-6] -batch [username@]host
               command

           Except for the [1msimple [22mvariant, command-line parameters are likely to
           change as git gains new features.

       stash.showIncludeUntracked
           If this is set to true, the [1mgit stash show [22mcommand will show the
           untracked files of a stash entry. Defaults to false. See the
           description of the [4mshow[24m command in [1mgit-stash[22m(1).

       stash.showPatch
           If this is set to true, the [1mgit stash show [22mcommand without an option
           will show the stash entry in patch form. Defaults to false. See the
           description of the [4mshow[24m command in [1mgit-stash[22m(1).

       stash.showStat
           If this is set to true, the [1mgit stash show [22mcommand without an option
           will show a diffstat of the stash entry. Defaults to true. See the
           description of the [4mshow[24m command in [1mgit-stash[22m(1).

       status.relativePaths
           By default, [1mgit-status[22m(1) shows paths relative to the current
           directory. Setting this variable to [1mfalse [22mshows paths relative to
           the repository root (this was the default for Git prior to v1.5.4).

       status.short
           Set to true to enable --short by default in [1mgit-status[22m(1). The
           option --no-short takes precedence over this variable.

       status.branch
           Set to true to enable --branch by default in [1mgit-status[22m(1). The
           option --no-branch takes precedence over this variable.

       status.aheadBehind
           Set to true to enable [1m--ahead-behind [22mand false to enable
           [1m--no-ahead-behind [22mby default in [1mgit-status[22m(1) for non-porcelain
           status formats. Defaults to true.

       status.displayCommentPrefix
           If set to true, [1mgit-status[22m(1) will insert a comment prefix before
           each output line (starting with [1mcore.commentChar[22m, i.e. # by
           default). This was the behavior of [1mgit-status[22m(1) in Git 1.8.4 and
           previous. Defaults to false.

       status.renameLimit
           The number of files to consider when performing rename detection in
           [1mgit-status[22m(1) and [1mgit-commit[22m(1). Defaults to the value of
           diff.renameLimit.

       status.renames
           Whether and how Git detects renames in [1mgit-status[22m(1) and [1mgit-[0m
           [1mcommit[22m(1) . If set to "false", rename detection is disabled. If set
           to "true", basic rename detection is enabled. If set to "copies" or
           "copy", Git will detect copies, as well. Defaults to the value of
           diff.renames.

       status.showStash
           If set to true, [1mgit-status[22m(1) will display the number of entries
           currently stashed away. Defaults to false.

       status.showUntrackedFiles
           By default, [1mgit-status[22m(1) and [1mgit-commit[22m(1) show files which are not
           currently tracked by Git. Directories which contain only untracked
           files, are shown with the directory name only. Showing untracked
           files means that Git needs to lstat() all the files in the whole
           repository, which might be slow on some systems. So, this variable
           controls how the commands display the untracked files. Possible
           values are:

           •   [1mno [22m- Show no untracked files.

           •   [1mnormal [22m- Show untracked files and directories.

           •   [1mall [22m- Show also individual files in untracked directories.

           If this variable is not specified, it defaults to [4mnormal[24m. All usual
           spellings for Boolean value [1mtrue [22mare taken as [1mnormal [22mand [1mfalse [22mas
           [1mno[22m. This variable can be overridden with the -u|--untracked-files
           option of [1mgit-status[22m(1) and [1mgit-commit[22m(1).

       status.submoduleSummary
           Defaults to false. If this is set to a non-zero number or true
           (identical to -1 or an unlimited number), the submodule summary will
           be enabled and a summary of commits for modified submodules will be
           shown (see --summary-limit option of [1mgit-submodule[22m(1)). Please note
           that the summary output command will be suppressed for all
           submodules when [1mdiff.ignoreSubmodules [22mis set to [4mall[24m or only for
           those submodules where [1msubmodule.[4m[22m<name>[24m[1m.ignore=all[22m. The only
           exception to that rule is that status and commit will show staged
           submodule changes. To also view the summary for ignored submodules
           you can either use the --ignore-submodules=dirty command-line option
           or the [4mgit[24m [4msubmodule[24m [4msummary[24m command, which shows a similar output
           but does not honor these settings.

       submodule.<name>.url
           The URL for a submodule. This variable is copied from the
           .gitmodules file to the git config via [4mgit[24m [4msubmodule[24m [4minit[24m. The user
           can change the configured URL before obtaining the submodule via [4mgit[0m
           [4msubmodule[24m [4mupdate[24m. If neither submodule.<name>.active nor
           submodule.active are set, the presence of this variable is used as a
           fallback to indicate whether the submodule is of interest to git
           commands. See [1mgit-submodule[22m(1) and [1mgitmodules[22m(5) for details.

       submodule.<name>.update
           The method by which a submodule is updated by [4mgit[24m [4msubmodule[24m [4mupdate[24m,
           which is the only affected command, others such as [4mgit[24m [4mcheckout[0m
           [4m--recurse-submodules[24m are unaffected. It exists for historical
           reasons, when [4mgit[24m [4msubmodule[24m was the only command to interact with
           submodules; settings like [1msubmodule.active [22mand [1mpull.rebase [22mare more
           specific. It is populated by [1mgit submodule init [22mfrom the
           [1mgitmodules[22m(5) file. See description of [4mupdate[24m command in [1mgit-[0m
           [1msubmodule[22m(1).

       submodule.<name>.branch
           The remote branch name for a submodule, used by [1mgit submodule update[0m
           [1m--remote[22m. Set this option to override the value found in the
           [1m.gitmodules [22mfile. See [1mgit-submodule[22m(1) and [1mgitmodules[22m(5) for
           details.

       submodule.<name>.fetchRecurseSubmodules
           This option can be used to control recursive fetching of this
           submodule. It can be overridden by using the
           --[no-]recurse-submodules command-line option to "git fetch" and
           "git pull". This setting will override that from in the
           [1mgitmodules[22m(5) file.

       submodule.<name>.ignore
           Defines under what circumstances "git status" and the diff family
           show a submodule as modified. When set to "all", it will never be
           considered modified (but it will nonetheless show up in the output
           of status and commit when it has been staged), "dirty" will ignore
           all changes to the submodule’s work tree and takes only differences
           between the HEAD of the submodule and the commit recorded in the
           superproject into account. "untracked" will additionally let
           submodules with modified tracked files in their work tree show up.
           Using "none" (the default when this option is not set) also shows
           submodules that have untracked files in their work tree as changed.
           This setting overrides any setting made in .gitmodules for this
           submodule, both settings can be overridden on the command line by
           using the "--ignore-submodules" option. The [4mgit[24m [4msubmodule[24m commands
           are not affected by this setting.

       submodule.<name>.active
           Boolean value indicating if the submodule is of interest to git
           commands. This config option takes precedence over the
           submodule.active config option. See [1mgitsubmodules[22m(7) for details.

       submodule.active
           A repeated field which contains a pathspec used to match against a
           submodule’s path to determine if the submodule is of interest to git
           commands. See [1mgitsubmodules[22m(7) for details.

       submodule.recurse
           A boolean indicating if commands should enable the
           [1m--recurse-submodules [22moption by default. Defaults to false.

           When set to true, it can be deactivated via the
           [1m--no-recurse-submodules [22moption. Note that some Git commands lacking
           this option may call some of the above commands affected by
           [1msubmodule.recurse[22m; for instance [1mgit remote update [22mwill call [1mgit[0m
           [1mfetch [22mbut does not have a [1m--no-recurse-submodules [22moption. For these
           commands a workaround is to temporarily change the configuration
           value by using [1mgit -c submodule.recurse=0[22m.

           The following list shows the commands that accept
           [1m--recurse-submodules [22mand whether they are supported by this setting.

           •   [1mcheckout[22m, [1mfetch[22m, [1mgrep[22m, [1mpull[22m, [1mpush[22m, [1mread-tree[22m, [1mreset[22m, [1mrestore [22mand
               [1mswitch [22mare always supported.

           •   [1mclone [22mand [1mls-files [22mare not supported.

           •   [1mbranch [22mis supported only if [1msubmodule.propagateBranches [22mis
               enabled

       submodule.propagateBranches
           [EXPERIMENTAL] A boolean that enables branching support when using
           [1m--recurse-submodules [22mor [1msubmodule.recurse=true[22m. Enabling this will
           allow certain commands to accept [1m--recurse-submodules [22mand certain
           commands that already accept [1m--recurse-submodules [22mwill now consider
           branches. Defaults to false.

       submodule.fetchJobs
           Specifies how many submodules are fetched/cloned at the same time. A
           positive integer allows up to that number of submodules fetched in
           parallel. A value of 0 will give some reasonable default. If unset,
           it defaults to 1.

       submodule.alternateLocation
           Specifies how the submodules obtain alternates when submodules are
           cloned. Possible values are [1mno[22m, [1msuperproject[22m. By default [1mno [22mis
           assumed, which doesn’t add references. When the value is set to
           [1msuperproject [22mthe submodule to be cloned computes its alternates
           location relative to the superprojects alternate.

       submodule.alternateErrorStrategy
           Specifies how to treat errors with the alternates for a submodule as
           computed via [1msubmodule.alternateLocation[22m. Possible values are
           [1mignore[22m, [1minfo[22m, [1mdie[22m. Default is [1mdie[22m. Note that if set to [1mignore [22mor
           [1minfo[22m, and if there is an error with the computed alternate, the
           clone proceeds as if no alternate was specified.

       tag.forceSignAnnotated
           A boolean to specify whether annotated tags created should be GPG
           signed. If [1m--annotate [22mis specified on the command line, it takes
           precedence over this option.

       tag.sort
           This variable controls the sort ordering of tags when displayed by
           [1mgit-tag[22m(1). Without the "--sort=<value>" option provided, the value
           of this variable will be used as the default.

       tag.gpgSign
           A boolean to specify whether all tags should be GPG signed. Use of
           this option when running in an automated script can result in a
           large number of tags being signed. It is therefore convenient to use
           an agent to avoid typing your gpg passphrase several times. Note
           that this option doesn’t affect tag signing behavior enabled by "-u
           <keyid>" or "--local-user=<keyid>" options.

       tar.umask
           This variable can be used to restrict the permission bits of tar
           archive entries. The default is 0002, which turns off the world
           write bit. The special value "user" indicates that the archiving
           user’s umask will be used instead. See umask(2) and [1mgit-archive[22m(1).

       Trace2 config settings are only read from the system and global config
       files; repository local and worktree config files and [1m-c [22mcommand line
       arguments are not respected.

       trace2.normalTarget
           This variable controls the normal target destination. It may be
           overridden by the [1mGIT_TRACE2 [22menvironment variable. The following
           table shows possible values.

       trace2.perfTarget
           This variable controls the performance target destination. It may be
           overridden by the [1mGIT_TRACE2_PERF [22menvironment variable. The
           following table shows possible values.

       trace2.eventTarget
           This variable controls the event target destination. It may be
           overridden by the [1mGIT_TRACE2_EVENT [22menvironment variable. The
           following table shows possible values.

           •   [1m0 [22mor [1mfalse [22m- Disables the target.

           •   [1m1 [22mor [1mtrue [22m- Writes to [1mSTDERR[22m.

           •   [[1m2-9[22m] - Writes to the already opened file descriptor.

           •   [4m<absolute-pathname>[24m - Writes to the file in append mode. If the
               target already exists and is a directory, the traces will be
               written to files (one per process) underneath the given
               directory.

           •   [1maf_unix:[22m[[4m<socket-type>[24m[1m:[22m][4m<absolute-pathname>[24m - Write to a Unix
               DomainSocket (on platforms that support them). Socket type can
               be either [1mstream [22mor [1mdgram[22m; if omitted Git will try both.

       trace2.normalBrief
           Boolean. When true [1mtime[22m, [1mfilename[22m, and [1mline [22mfields are omitted from
           normal output. May be overridden by the [1mGIT_TRACE2_BRIEF [22menvironment
           variable. Defaults to false.

       trace2.perfBrief
           Boolean. When true [1mtime[22m, [1mfilename[22m, and [1mline [22mfields are omitted from
           PERF output. May be overridden by the [1mGIT_TRACE2_PERF_BRIEF[0m
           environment variable. Defaults to false.

       trace2.eventBrief
           Boolean. When true [1mtime[22m, [1mfilename[22m, and [1mline [22mfields are omitted from
           event output. May be overridden by the [1mGIT_TRACE2_EVENT_BRIEF[0m
           environment variable. Defaults to false.

       trace2.eventNesting
           Integer. Specifies desired depth of nested regions in the event
           output. Regions deeper than this value will be omitted. May be
           overridden by the [1mGIT_TRACE2_EVENT_NESTING [22menvironment variable.
           Defaults to 2.

       trace2.configParams
           A comma-separated list of patterns of "important" config settings
           that should be recorded in the trace2 output. For example,
           [1mcore.*[22m,remote.*.url would cause the trace2 output to contain events
           listing each configured remote. May be overridden by the
           [1mGIT_TRACE2_CONFIG_PARAMS [22menvironment variable. Unset by default.

       trace2.envVars
           A comma-separated list of "important" environment variables that
           should be recorded in the trace2 output. For example,
           [1mGIT_HTTP_USER_AGENT[22m,GIT_CONFIG would cause the trace2 output to
           contain events listing the overrides for HTTP user agent and the
           location of the Git configuration file (assuming any are set). May
           be overridden by the [1mGIT_TRACE2_ENV_VARS [22menvironment variable. Unset
           by default.

       trace2.destinationDebug
           Boolean. When true Git will print error messages when a trace target
           destination cannot be opened for writing. By default, these errors
           are suppressed and tracing is silently disabled. May be overridden
           by the [1mGIT_TRACE2_DST_DEBUG [22menvironment variable.

       trace2.maxFiles
           Integer. When writing trace files to a target directory, do not
           write additional traces if doing so would exceed this many files.
           Instead, write a sentinel file that will block further tracing to
           this directory. Defaults to 0, which disables this check.

       trailer.separators
           This option tells which characters are recognized as trailer
           separators. By default only [4m:[24m is recognized as a trailer separator,
           except that [4m=[24m is always accepted on the command line for
           compatibility with other git commands.

           The first character given by this option will be the default
           character used when another separator is not specified in the config
           for this trailer.

           For example, if the value for this option is "%=$", then only lines
           using the format [4m<key><sep><value>[24m with <sep> containing [4m%[24m, [4m=[24m or [4m$[0m
           and then spaces will be considered trailers. And [4m%[24m will be the
           default separator used, so by default trailers will appear like:
           [4m<key>%[24m [4m<value>[24m (one percent sign and one space will appear between
           the key and the value).

       trailer.where
           This option tells where a new trailer will be added.

           This can be [1mend[22m, which is the default, [1mstart[22m, [1mafter [22mor [1mbefore[22m.

           If it is [1mend[22m, then each new trailer will appear at the end of the
           existing trailers.

           If it is [1mstart[22m, then each new trailer will appear at the start,
           instead of the end, of the existing trailers.

           If it is [1mafter[22m, then each new trailer will appear just after the
           last trailer with the same <key>.

           If it is [1mbefore[22m, then each new trailer will appear just before the
           first trailer with the same <key>.

       trailer.ifexists
           This option makes it possible to choose what action will be
           performed when there is already at least one trailer with the same
           <key> in the input.

           The valid values for this option are: [1maddIfDifferentNeighbor [22m(this
           is the default), [1maddIfDifferent[22m, [1madd[22m, [1mreplace [22mor [1mdoNothing[22m.

           With [1maddIfDifferentNeighbor[22m, a new trailer will be added only if no
           trailer with the same (<key>, <value>) pair is above or below the
           line where the new trailer will be added.

           With [1maddIfDifferent[22m, a new trailer will be added only if no trailer
           with the same (<key>, <value>) pair is already in the input.

           With [1madd[22m, a new trailer will be added, even if some trailers with
           the same (<key>, <value>) pair are already in the input.

           With [1mreplace[22m, an existing trailer with the same <key> will be
           deleted and the new trailer will be added. The deleted trailer will
           be the closest one (with the same <key>) to the place where the new
           one will be added.

           With [1mdoNothing[22m, nothing will be done; that is no new trailer will be
           added if there is already one with the same <key> in the input.

       trailer.ifmissing
           This option makes it possible to choose what action will be
           performed when there is not yet any trailer with the same <key> in
           the input.

           The valid values for this option are: [1madd [22m(this is the default) and
           [1mdoNothing[22m.

           With [1madd[22m, a new trailer will be added.

           With [1mdoNothing[22m, nothing will be done.

       trailer.<keyAlias>.key
           Defines a <keyAlias> for the <key>. The <keyAlias> must be a prefix
           (case does not matter) of the <key>. For example, in [1mgit config[0m
           [1mtrailer.ack.key [22m"Acked-by" the "Acked-by" is the <key> and the "ack"
           is the <keyAlias>. This configuration allows the shorter [1m--trailer[0m
           "ack:[1m...[22m" invocation on the command line using the "ack" <keyAlias>
           instead of the longer [1m--trailer [22m"Acked-by:[1m...[22m".

           At the end of the <key>, a separator can appear and then some space
           characters. By default the only valid separator is [4m:[24m, but this can
           be changed using the [1mtrailer.separators [22mconfig variable.

           If there is a separator in the key, then it overrides the default
           separator when adding the trailer.

       trailer.<keyAlias>.where
           This option takes the same values as the [4mtrailer.where[24m configuration
           variable and it overrides what is specified by that option for
           trailers with the specified <keyAlias>.

       trailer.<keyAlias>.ifexists
           This option takes the same values as the [4mtrailer.ifexists[0m
           configuration variable and it overrides what is specified by that
           option for trailers with the specified <keyAlias>.

       trailer.<keyAlias>.ifmissing
           This option takes the same values as the [4mtrailer.ifmissing[0m
           configuration variable and it overrides what is specified by that
           option for trailers with the specified <keyAlias>.

       trailer.<keyAlias>.command
           Deprecated in favor of [4mtrailer.<keyAlias>.cmd[24m. This option behaves
           in the same way as [4mtrailer.<keyAlias>.cmd[24m, except that it doesn’t
           pass anything as argument to the specified command. Instead the
           first occurrence of substring $ARG is replaced by the <value> that
           would be passed as argument.

           Note that $ARG in the user’s command is only replaced once and that
           the original way of replacing $ARG is not safe.

           When both [4mtrailer.<keyAlias>.cmd[24m and [4mtrailer.<keyAlias>.command[24m are
           given for the same <keyAlias>, [4mtrailer.<keyAlias>.cmd[24m is used and
           [4mtrailer.<keyAlias>.command[24m is ignored.

       trailer.<keyAlias>.cmd
           This option can be used to specify a shell command that will be
           called once to automatically add a trailer with the specified
           <keyAlias>, and then called each time a [4m--trailer[24m [4m<keyAlias>=<value>[0m
           argument is specified to modify the <value> of the trailer that this
           option would produce.

           When the specified command is first called to add a trailer with the
           specified <keyAlias>, the behavior is as if a special [4m--trailer[0m
           [4m<keyAlias>=<value>[24m argument was added at the beginning of the "git
           interpret-trailers" command, where <value> is taken to be the
           standard output of the command with any leading and trailing
           whitespace trimmed off.

           If some [4m--trailer[24m [4m<keyAlias>=<value>[24m arguments are also passed on
           the command line, the command is called again once for each of these
           arguments with the same <keyAlias>. And the <value> part of these
           arguments, if any, will be passed to the command as its first
           argument. This way the command can produce a <value> computed from
           the <value> passed in the [4m--trailer[24m [4m<keyAlias>=<value>[24m argument.

       transfer.credentialsInUrl
           A configured URL can contain plaintext credentials in the form
           [4m<protocol>[24m[1m://[4m[22m<user>[24m[1m:[4m[22m<password>[24m[1m@[4m[22m<domain>[24m[1m/[4m[22m<path>[24m. You may want to warn
           or forbid the use of such configuration (in favor of using [1mgit-[0m
           [1mcredential[22m(1)). This will be used on [1mgit-clone[22m(1), [1mgit-fetch[22m(1),
           [1mgit-push[22m(1), and any other direct use of the configured URL.

           Note that this is currently limited to detecting credentials in
           [1mremote.[4m[22m<name>[24m[1m.url [22mconfiguration; it won’t detect credentials in
           [1mremote.[4m[22m<name>[24m[1m.pushurl [22mconfiguration.

           You might want to enable this to prevent inadvertent credentials
           exposure, e.g. because:

           •   The OS or system where you’re running git may not provide a way
               or otherwise allow you to configure the permissions of the
               configuration file where the username and/or password are
               stored.

           •   Even if it does, having such data stored "at rest" might expose
               you in other ways, e.g. a backup process might copy the data to
               another system.

           •   The git programs will pass the full URL to one another as
               arguments on the command-line, meaning the credentials will be
               exposed to other unprivileged users on systems that allow them
               to see the full process list of other users. On linux the
               "hidepid" setting documented in procfs(5) allows for configuring
               this behavior.

               If such concerns don’t apply to you then you probably don’t need
               to be concerned about credentials exposure due to storing
               sensitive data in git’s configuration files. If you do want to
               use this, set [1mtransfer.credentialsInUrl [22mto one of these values:

           •   [1mallow [22m(default): Git will proceed with its activity without
               warning.

           •   [1mwarn[22m: Git will write a warning message to [1mstderr [22mwhen parsing a
               URL with a plaintext credential.

           •   [1mdie[22m: Git will write a failure message to [1mstderr [22mwhen parsing a
               URL with a plaintext credential.

       transfer.fsckObjects
           When [1mfetch.fsckObjects [22mor [1mreceive.fsckObjects [22mare not set, the value
           of this variable is used instead. Defaults to false.

           When set, the fetch or receive will abort in the case of a malformed
           object or a link to a nonexistent object. In addition, various other
           issues are checked for, including legacy issues (see [1mfsck.[4m[22m<msg-id>[24m),
           and potential security issues like the existence of a [1m.GIT [22mdirectory
           or a malicious [1m.gitmodules [22mfile (see the release notes for v2.2.1
           and v2.17.1 for details). Other sanity and security checks may be
           added in future releases.

           On the receiving side, failing fsckObjects will make those objects
           unreachable, see "QUARANTINE ENVIRONMENT" in [1mgit-receive-pack[22m(1). On
           the fetch side, malformed objects will instead be left unreferenced
           in the repository.

           Due to the non-quarantine nature of the [1mfetch.fsckObjects[0m
           implementation it cannot be relied upon to leave the object store
           clean like [1mreceive.fsckObjects [22mcan.

           As objects are unpacked they’re written to the object store, so
           there can be cases where malicious objects get introduced even
           though the "fetch" failed, only to have a subsequent "fetch" succeed
           because only new incoming objects are checked, not those that have
           already been written to the object store. That difference in
           behavior should not be relied upon. In the future, such objects may
           be quarantined for "fetch" as well.

           For now, the paranoid need to find some way to emulate the
           quarantine environment if they’d like the same protection as "push".
           E.g. in the case of an internal mirror do the mirroring in two
           steps, one to fetch the untrusted objects, and then do a second
           "push" (which will use the quarantine) to another internal repo, and
           have internal clients consume this pushed-to repository, or embargo
           internal fetches and only allow them once a full "fsck" has run (and
           no new fetches have happened in the meantime).

       transfer.hideRefs
           String(s) [1mreceive-pack [22mand [1mupload-pack [22muse to decide which refs to
           omit from their initial advertisements. Use more than one definition
           to specify multiple prefix strings. A ref that is under the
           hierarchies listed in the value of this variable is excluded, and is
           hidden when responding to [1mgit push [22mor [1mgit fetch[22m. See
           [1mreceive.hideRefs [22mand [1muploadpack.hideRefs [22mfor program-specific
           versions of this config.

           You may also include a ! in front of the ref name to negate the
           entry, explicitly exposing it, even if an earlier entry marked it as
           hidden. If you have multiple hideRefs values, later entries override
           earlier ones (and entries in more-specific config files override
           less-specific ones).

           If a namespace is in use, the namespace prefix is stripped from each
           reference before it is matched against [1mtransfer.hiderefs [22mpatterns.
           In order to match refs before stripping, add a [1m^ [22min front of the ref
           name. If you combine ! and [1m^[22m, ! must be specified first.

           For example, if [1mrefs/heads/master [22mis specified in [1mtransfer.hideRefs[0m
           and the current namespace is [1mfoo[22m, then
           [1mrefs/namespaces/foo/refs/heads/master [22mis omitted from the
           advertisements. If [1muploadpack.allowRefInWant [22mis set, [1mupload-pack[0m
           will treat [1mwant-ref refs/heads/master [22min a protocol v2 [1mfetch [22mcommand
           as if [1mrefs/namespaces/foo/refs/heads/master [22mdid not exist.
           [1mreceive-pack[22m, on the other hand, will still advertise the object id
           the ref is pointing to without mentioning its name (a so-called
           ".have" line).

           Even if you hide refs, a client may still be able to steal the
           target objects via the techniques described in the "SECURITY"
           section of the [1mgitnamespaces[22m(7) man page; it’s best to keep private
           data in a separate repository.

       transfer.unpackLimit
           When [1mfetch.unpackLimit [22mor [1mreceive.unpackLimit [22mare not set, the value
           of this variable is used instead. The default value is 100.

       transfer.advertiseSID
           Boolean. When true, client and server processes will advertise their
           unique session IDs to their remote counterpart. Defaults to false.

       transfer.bundleURI
           When [1mtrue[22m, local [1mgit clone [22mcommands will request bundle information
           from the remote server (if advertised) and download bundles before
           continuing the clone through the Git protocol. Defaults to [1mfalse[22m.

       transfer.advertiseObjectInfo
           When [1mtrue[22m, the [1mobject-info [22mcapability is advertised by servers.
           Defaults to false.

       uploadarchive.allowUnreachable
           If true, allow clients to use [1mgit archive --remote [22mto request any
           tree, whether reachable from the ref tips or not. See the discussion
           in the "SECURITY" section of [1mgit-upload-archive[22m(1) for more details.
           Defaults to [1mfalse[22m.

       uploadpack.hideRefs
           This variable is the same as [1mtransfer.hideRefs[22m, but applies only to
           [1mupload-pack [22m(and so affects only fetches, not pushes). An attempt to
           fetch a hidden ref by [1mgit fetch [22mwill fail. See also
           [1muploadpack.allowTipSHA1InWant[22m.

       uploadpack.allowTipSHA1InWant
           When [1muploadpack.hideRefs [22mis in effect, allow [1mupload-pack [22mto accept a
           fetch request that asks for an object at the tip of a hidden ref (by
           default, such a request is rejected). See also [1muploadpack.hideRefs[22m.
           Even if this is false, a client may be able to steal objects via the
           techniques described in the "SECURITY" section of the
           [1mgitnamespaces[22m(7) man page; it’s best to keep private data in a
           separate repository.

       uploadpack.allowReachableSHA1InWant
           Allow [1mupload-pack [22mto accept a fetch request that asks for an object
           that is reachable from any ref tip. However, note that calculating
           object reachability is computationally expensive. Defaults to [1mfalse[22m.
           Even if this is false, a client may be able to steal objects via the
           techniques described in the "SECURITY" section of the
           [1mgitnamespaces[22m(7) man page; it’s best to keep private data in a
           separate repository.

       uploadpack.allowAnySHA1InWant
           Allow [1mupload-pack [22mto accept a fetch request that asks for any object
           at all. It implies [1muploadpack.allowTipSHA1InWant [22mand
           [1muploadpack.allowReachableSHA1InWant[22m. If set to [1mtrue [22mit will enable
           both of them, it set to [1mfalse [22mit will disable both of them. By
           default not set.

       uploadpack.keepAlive
           When [1mupload-pack [22mhas started [1mpack-objects[22m, there may be a quiet
           period while [1mpack-objects [22mprepares the pack. Normally it would
           output progress information, but if [1m--quiet [22mwas used for the fetch,
           [1mpack-objects [22mwill output nothing at all until the pack data begins.
           Some clients and networks may consider the server to be hung and
           give up. Setting this option instructs [1mupload-pack [22mto send an empty
           keepalive packet every [1muploadpack.keepAlive [22mseconds. Setting this
           option to 0 disables keepalive packets entirely. The default is 5
           seconds.

       uploadpack.packObjectsHook
           If this option is set, when [1mupload-pack [22mwould run [1mgit pack-objects[0m
           to create a packfile for a client, it will run this shell command
           instead. The [1mpack-objects [22mcommand and arguments it [4mwould[24m have run
           (including the [1mgit pack-objects [22mat the beginning) are appended to
           the shell command. The stdin and stdout of the hook are treated as
           if [1mpack-objects [22mitself was run. I.e., [1mupload-pack [22mwill feed input
           intended for [1mpack-objects [22mto the hook, and expects a completed
           packfile on stdout.

           Note that this configuration variable is only respected when it is
           specified in protected configuration (see the section called
           “SCOPES”). This is a safety measure against fetching from untrusted
           repositories.

       uploadpack.allowFilter
           If this option is set, [1mupload-pack [22mwill support partial clone and
           partial fetch object filtering.

       uploadpackfilter.allow
           Provides a default value for unspecified object filters (see: the
           below configuration variable). If set to [1mtrue[22m, this will also enable
           all filters which get added in the future. Defaults to [1mtrue[22m.

       uploadpackfilter.<filter>.allow
           Explicitly allow or ban the object filter corresponding to [4m<filter>[24m,
           where [4m<filter>[24m may be one of: [1mblob:none[22m, [1mblob:limit[22m, [1mobject:type[22m,
           [1mtree[22m, [1msparse:oid[22m, or [1mcombine[22m. If using combined filters, both
           [1mcombine [22mand all of the nested filter kinds must be allowed. Defaults
           to [1muploadpackfilter.allow[22m.

       uploadpackfilter.tree.maxDepth
           Only allow [1m--filter=tree:[4m[22m<n>[24m when [4m<n>[24m is no more than the value of
           [1muploadpackfilter.tree.maxDepth[22m. If set, this also implies
           [1muploadpackfilter.tree.allow=true[22m, unless this configuration variable
           had already been set. Has no effect if unset.

       uploadpack.allowRefInWant
           If this option is set, [1mupload-pack [22mwill support the [1mref-in-want[0m
           feature of the protocol version 2 [1mfetch [22mcommand. This feature is
           intended for the benefit of load-balanced servers which may not have
           the same view of what OIDs their refs point to due to replication
           delay.

       url.<base>.insteadOf
           Any URL that starts with this value will be rewritten to start,
           instead, with <base>. In cases where some site serves a large number
           of repositories, and serves them with multiple access methods, and
           some users need to use different access methods, this feature allows
           people to specify any of the equivalent URLs and have Git
           automatically rewrite the URL to the best alternative for the
           particular user, even for a never-before-seen repository on the
           site. When more than one insteadOf strings match a given URL, the
           longest match is used.

           Note that any protocol restrictions will be applied to the rewritten
           URL. If the rewrite changes the URL to use a custom protocol or
           remote helper, you may need to adjust the [1mprotocol.*.allow [22mconfig to
           permit the request. In particular, protocols you expect to use for
           submodules must be set to [1malways [22mrather than the default of [1muser[22m.
           See the description of [1mprotocol.allow [22mabove.

       url.<base>.pushInsteadOf
           Any URL that starts with this value will not be pushed to; instead,
           it will be rewritten to start with <base>, and the resulting URL
           will be pushed to. In cases where some site serves a large number of
           repositories, and serves them with multiple access methods, some of
           which do not allow push, this feature allows people to specify a
           pull-only URL and have Git automatically use an appropriate URL to
           push, even for a never-before-seen repository on the site. When more
           than one pushInsteadOf strings match a given URL, the longest match
           is used. If a remote has an explicit pushurl, Git will ignore this
           setting for that remote.

       user.name, user.email, author.name, author.email, committer.name,
       committer.email
           The [1muser.name [22mand [1muser.email [22mvariables determine what ends up in the
           [1mauthor [22mand [1mcommitter [22mfields of commit objects. If you need the
           [1mauthor [22mor [1mcommitter [22mto be different, the [1mauthor.name[22m, [1mauthor.email[22m,
           [1mcommitter.name[22m, or [1mcommitter.email [22mvariables can be set. All of
           these can be overridden by the [1mGIT_AUTHOR_NAME[22m, [1mGIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL[22m,
           [1mGIT_COMMITTER_NAME[22m, [1mGIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL[22m, and [1mEMAIL [22menvironment
           variables.

           Note that the [1mname [22mforms of these variables conventionally refer to
           some form of a personal name. See [1mgit-commit[22m(1) and the environment
           variables section of [1mgit[22m(1) for more information on these settings
           and the [1mcredential.username [22moption if you’re looking for
           authentication credentials instead.

       user.useConfigOnly
           Instruct Git to avoid trying to guess defaults for [1muser.email [22mand
           [1muser.name[22m, and instead retrieve the values only from the
           configuration. For example, if you have multiple email addresses and
           would like to use a different one for each repository, then with
           this configuration option set to [1mtrue [22min the global config along
           with a name, Git will prompt you to set up an email before making
           new commits in a newly cloned repository. Defaults to [1mfalse[22m.

       user.signingKey
           If [1mgit-tag[22m(1) or [1mgit-commit[22m(1) is not selecting the key you want it
           to automatically when creating a signed tag or commit, you can
           override the default selection with this variable. This option is
           passed unchanged to gpg’s --local-user parameter, so you may specify
           a key using any method that gpg supports. If gpg.format is set to
           [1mssh [22mthis can contain the path to either your private ssh key or the
           public key when ssh-agent is used. Alternatively it can contain a
           public key prefixed with [1mkey:: [22mdirectly (e.g.: "key::ssh-rsa XXXXXX
           identifier"). The private key needs to be available via ssh-agent.
           If not set Git will call gpg.ssh.defaultKeyCommand (e.g.: "ssh-add
           -L") and try to use the first key available. For backward
           compatibility, a raw key which begins with "ssh-", such as "ssh-rsa
           XXXXXX identifier", is treated as "key::ssh-rsa XXXXXX identifier",
           but this form is deprecated; use the [1mkey:: [22mform instead.

       versionsort.prereleaseSuffix (deprecated)
           Deprecated alias for [1mversionsort.suffix[22m. Ignored if
           [1mversionsort.suffix [22mis set.

       versionsort.suffix
           Even when version sort is used in [1mgit-tag[22m(1), tagnames with the same
           base version but different suffixes are still sorted
           lexicographically, resulting e.g. in prerelease tags appearing after
           the main release (e.g. "1.0-rc1" after "1.0"). This variable can be
           specified to determine the sorting order of tags with different
           suffixes.

           By specifying a single suffix in this variable, any tagname
           containing that suffix will appear before the corresponding main
           release. E.g. if the variable is set to "-rc", then all "1.0-rcX"
           tags will appear before "1.0". If specified multiple times, once per
           suffix, then the order of suffixes in the configuration will
           determine the sorting order of tagnames with those suffixes. E.g. if
           "-pre" appears before "-rc" in the configuration, then all
           "1.0-preX" tags will be listed before any "1.0-rcX" tags. The
           placement of the main release tag relative to tags with various
           suffixes can be determined by specifying the empty suffix among
           those other suffixes. E.g. if the suffixes "-rc", "", "-ck", and
           "-bfs" appear in the configuration in this order, then all
           "v4.8-rcX" tags are listed first, followed by "v4.8", then
           "v4.8-ckX" and finally "v4.8-bfsX".

           If more than one suffix matches the same tagname, then that tagname
           will be sorted according to the suffix which starts at the earliest
           position in the tagname. If more than one different matching suffix
           starts at that earliest position, then that tagname will be sorted
           according to the longest of those suffixes. The sorting order
           between different suffixes is undefined if they are in multiple
           config files.

       web.browser
           Specify a web browser that may be used by some commands. Currently
           only [1mgit-instaweb[22m(1) and [1mgit-help[22m(1) may use it.

       worktree.guessRemote
           If no branch is specified and neither [1m-b [22mnor [1m-B [22mnor [1m--detach [22mis
           used, then [1mgit worktree add [22mdefaults to creating a new branch from
           HEAD. If [1mworktree.guessRemote [22mis set to true, [1mworktree add [22mtries to
           find a remote-tracking branch whose name uniquely matches the new
           branch name. If such a branch exists, it is checked out and set as
           "upstream" for the new branch. If no such match can be found, it
           falls back to creating a new branch from the current HEAD.

       worktree.useRelativePaths
           Link worktrees using relative paths (when "true") or absolute paths
           (when "false"). This is particularly useful for setups where the
           repository and worktrees may be moved between different locations or
           environments. Defaults to "false".

           Note that setting [1mworktree.useRelativePaths [22mto "true" implies
           enabling the [1mextension.relativeWorktrees [22mconfig (see [1mgit-config[22m(1)),
           thus making it incompatible with older versions of Git.

[1mBUGS[0m
       When using the deprecated [[1msection.subsection[22m] syntax, changing a value
       will result in adding a multi-line key instead of a change, if the
       subsection is given with at least one uppercase character. For example
       when the config looks like

             [section.subsection]
               key = value1

       and running [1mgit config section.Subsection.key value2 [22mwill result in

             [section.subsection]
               key = value1
               key = value2
